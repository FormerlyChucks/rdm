<h1>Too Many Requests</h1>
<p>We're sorry, but you appear to be a bot and we've seen too many requests
from you lately. we enforce a hard speed limit on requests that appear to come
from bots to prevent abuse.</p>

<p>If you are not a bot but are spoofing one via your browser's user agent
string: please change your user agent string to avoid seeing this message
again.</p>

<p>Please wait 5 second(s) and try again.</p>

    <p>As a reminder to developers, we recommend that clients make no
    more than one request every two seconds to avoid seeing this message.</p>
