    <h1>Python Forum</h1>
    <br>A Forum, made with Python<br/>
    The goal is that you should have your own textboard/forum by the end of this guide. You should have Git, Pip and Python installed.
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <dl>
        <dd>- Dark Mode<br/></dd>
        <dd>- Board Creation</dd>
        <dd>- Thread and Comment Creation</dd>
        <dd>- No Tracking</dd>
        <dd>- Easy to Setup</dd>
    </dl>    
    <h2>Setup/Run</h2>
    <br>This should be easy to set up.<br/>
    <br>Simply clone the repo:<br/>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">git clone https://github.com/titletrack/Forum</code></pre>
    <br>Change into the directory:<br/>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">cd Forum</code></pre>
    <br>Install requirements:<br/>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
    <br>Actually run it:<br/>
    <pre><code class="plaintext">python3 app.py</code></pre>
    Your terminal should give you something like this:
    <pre><code class="bash">
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Customization</h2>
    In your browser, navigate to the http site.<br/>
    You should have a white screen that says "Be the first to create a board?". Tap the "New Board" button to create your first board!. "Slug" is the board's slug, "Title" is the board's title. You will also have to create a [f]irst post. To make a board called "awesome" that links from /a/, your slug would be "a" and your title would be "awesome". After creating your board, go back to the main page.
    To edit the "[this is a footer]" message, open /templates/footer/html and edit the message. To edit the "[name]", you will need to adjust line 7 in /templates/base.html and line 22 in /templates/common.html. To edit "[logo]", do the same for line 3 in /templates/header.html.<br/>
    That should be all! If you have any problems, create an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/diogenesjunior2/Forum">GitHub repository</a>.
