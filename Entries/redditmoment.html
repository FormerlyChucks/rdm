    <h1>About /r/redditmoment</h1>
    Since it was created by <a href="https://reddit.com/u/dedsnek">/u/dedsnek</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/redditmoment">/r/redditmoment</a> was filled with hate. Not "mocking redditors" or critiquing them, but transphobia, homophobia and racism. I, <a href="https://reddit.com/u/diogenesjunior">/u/diogenesjunior</a>, was a moderator of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/pewdiepiesubmissions">/r/pewdiepiesubmissions</a>. <a href="https://reddit.com/r/redditmoment">/r/redditmoment</a> constantly brigaded the subreddit and harassed it's users. As a moderator of this subreddit, cleaning up after brigades was hard and hearing the problems brought upon the subreddit's users was disheartening. <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aadre">/u/aadre</a> had used <a href="https://reddit.com/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> to become the subreddit's new moderator, but they never did anything with it, leaving it unmoderated. <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aadre">/u/aadre</a> eventually <a href="https://www.removeddit.com/r/needamod/comments/gt41gn/rredditmoment_is_looking_for_mods_40k_members">posted in /r/needamod</a> asking for new mods, and I commented in the thread. I was added as a moderator within an hour. I asked <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aadre">/u/aadre</a> if they would mind making me the sub's top moderator, as then I would have control of the subreddit. <a href="https://reddit.com/u/aadre">/u/aadre</a> promptly removed the other moderators and himself, and then I reinvited them. After that, I didn't use reddit for two days due to outside reasons. On the third day, I came back to reddit and removed all of the subreddit's moderators except for myself, and then set the subreddit to private. I then <a href="https://www.removeddit.com/r/RequestABot/comments/gunb4i/a_bot_to_remove_and_lock_every_post_in_a_subreddit/">asked for a bot to help clear out the subreddit</a>. The subreddit's users were reasonably mad about the sub being private and I had other things to worry about than reddit drama, so I added two mods, <a href="https://reddit.com/u/Merari01">/u/Merari01</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/u/Bardfinn">/u/Bardfinn</a>. These users told me that I should open the subreddit back up and set very clear rules down to prevent the hate. I listened to them and redditmoment is more or less a cleaner place. <b><i>Those that choose to be mad at <a href="https://reddit.com/u/Merari01">/u/Merari01</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/u/Bardfinn">/u/Bardfinn</a> are simple minded, as the subreddit would still be private without them.</i></b>
