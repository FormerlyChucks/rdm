<h1>/r/redditmoment</h1>
Since it was created by /u/dedsnek, /r/redditmoment was filled with hate. Not "mocking redditors" or critiquing them, but transphobia, homophobia and racism. I, /u/diogenesjunior, was a moderator of /r/pewdiepiesubmissions. /r/redditmoment constantly brigaded the subreddit and harassed it's users. As a moderator of this subreddit, cleaning up after brigades was hard and hearing the problems brought upon the subreddit's users was disheartening. /u/aadre had used /r/redditrequest to become the subreddit's new moderator, but they never did anything with it, leaving it unmoderated. /u/aadre eventually posted in /r/needamod asking for new mods, and I commented in the thread. I was added as a moderator within an hour. I asked /u/aadre if they would mind making me the sub's top moderator, as then I would have control of the subreddit. /u/aadre promptly removed the other moderators and himself, and then I reinvited them. After that, I didn't use reddit for two days due to outside reasons. On the third day, I came back to reddit and removed all of the subreddit's moderators except for myself, and then set the subreddit to private. I then asked for a bot to help clear out the subreddit. The subreddit's users were reasonably mad about the sub being private and I had other things to worry about than reddit drama, so I added two mods, /u/Merari01 and /u/Bardfinn. These users told me that I should open the subreddit back up and set very clear rules down to prevent the hate. I listened to them and redditmoment is more or less a cleaner place. Those that choose to be mad at /u/Merari01 and /u/Bardfinn are simple minded, as the subreddit would still be private without them.<p>
