That's the same exact mindset with Zionism, except applied to an elite class of (self-proclaimed) Jews. Zionism is a form of extremism. There are extremists in every group; it would be naive to think there aren't extremists among Jews. There are a good number of people in Israel who are Jewish, know what Zionism is and protest it; you can find this with a simple google (or youtube) search. Zionists hold extremists beliefs and there's a reason even Jewish citizens of Israel are against them. ": {} }

You'll read blogs that the CIA and Nazis were involved and shot and buried children in "Holocaust style mass graves." One of his most notorious abusers involved, DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET (baptized Joseph-Maurice-Stanislas; name change?) who had transferred orphans to psychiatric hospitals to secure federal funding, which was more generous for hospitals than for orphanages. Healthy children were diagnosed as mentally unfit and sent to mental hospitals. In some instances, such as Mont-Providence, entire orphanages were reclassified as psychiatric institutions. Serving mammon to the fullest, what a disgusting sinner and those who were involved in the Catholic church. I'm told the Catholic Church was and is corrupt and that Jesuits were all communists. Then why did the Catholic Church (as a whole, or elements within it?) work with Duplessis? In 1937, he introduced An Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda, called the Padlock Act, which prohibited printing or publishing any document (including newspapers and pamphlets) that promoted communism. He sounds more like a Roy Cohn to me than anything else. Remember, Herzl dispised diaspora Jews with such disdain that he attacked them and called them dirty and disgusting kikes. Duplessis did, however, call for the emigration of Jews to Canada, during WW2, however, he did it under the auspices that his opposition were communist Jews. With regards to the Nazi connections, I've found a few other references to this story from Canadian news. Duplessis orphans want Mtl. burial site dug up. An article that claims that the survivors believe there is a mass grave, also claims that the unclaimed bodies of orphans were sold to medical schools for $10 each, as per Canadian law. Note: neither of the two sites make any claims about Nazis or the CIA. #Pedophiles and the Vatican ___ Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and registered sex offender who served 13 months in jail from 2009 to 2010, with Ghislane Maxwell meets Saint John Paul II in an undated photo at Epstein’s home. https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UrS7MDFQQvw/V4gTbNnVJCI/AAAAAAAAJfs/IBix0ZLccwgJrG4XAhS1DZqjjCSPerCHgCLcB/s400/Jeffrey%2BEpstein%2Bjohn%2Bpaul%2Bii.jpg Epstein rubbed shoulder with a who’s who of the elite in the world at his private Caribbean island and Palm Beach home where they stayed as his guests. It is rumored he ran a pedophile sex ring stocked with underage children. Names included in his black book which surfaced are: Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Bill Richardson, Leslie Wexner, Mark Katzenellenbogen, Elie Weisel, Edward de Rothschild, Evelyn de Rothschild, David Rockefeller, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Henry Kissinger, Peter Soros, John Kerry, Ernst Hanover, Marie Hapsburg, Prince Andrew (of the United Kingdom), Viscount William Astor, Lord Alistair McAlpine, John Micklethwait, Ghislaine Maxwell, Laurie Oppenheim, Eric Margolis, Peter Mandelson, Constantine Niarchos, Kevin Maxwell, Jose Azna, Prince Salman (of Saudi Arabia), Edward Kennedy, Edgar Bronfman, Ehud Barak, Courtney Love, etc... https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oKLfz0T74PU/V4g-koJdUyI/AAAAAAAAJgA/qmE2isceq2kCmBGQgx8yi1xfH6E2smktQCLcB/s400/246FAE4700000578-0-image-a-4_1420492905144.jpg One would think that John Paul II would have had handlers or priests who had contacts with police or intelligence services that would have notified him of the less than stellar reputation of Jeffrey Epstein. Then again, maybe he knew. After all in 1990 John Paul awarded Jimmy Savile papal knighthood by making him a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KCSG) and he gained further Vatican honors when the Sovereign Military Order of Malta awarded him The Order pro Merito Melitensi. Allegations had swirled around Savile and complaints were made to law enforcement officers. The first complaint was a male claiming in 1963 to have been raped by Jimmy. Was there no one doing due diligence at the Vatican? https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RK3RcR9ePUQ/V4g_5nAGSlI/AAAAAAAAJgM/HvZnpncexhEiPNO5vP3uHBYt3NBL7ZyegCLcB/s400/Pope-and-Jimmy-Sav_2380825b.jpg Knight Commander Jimmy Savile and Saint John Paul II “Many dress up as Christians but are not really Christians.” How apt! Jesus the Christ said, “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you shall know them...so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the bad tree bringeth forth bad fruit...Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.” (Matthew 7, 15-20) The key difference between the myriad of cases where Francis has decided not to judge & defrock priests and the case of Mauro Inzoli was simply what one of the victims said on the witness stand. The English speaking Novus Ordo religious media has not reported on this one aspect because it is an embarrassment to their bosses. The Israeli media has said of the testimony, “There is no such ritual in the Old Testament or in Judaism.” Why then is there an unspoken tradition of sexually abusing minors in Orthodox Judasim? Many yeshivas of the ‘elder brothers’ are rife with pederasty. In March of this year, twenty Orthodox males in Jerusalem were arrested for sexually abusing children. Why does the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics by Rabbi Avraham Steinberg, who was recently appointed by Francis to the Pontifical Academy of Life, say that it is okay for a man to have sexual relations with a boy under the age of nine? Where there is smoke, there is fire. https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7ZI5GQ9XqOU/WUgTNVn_cgI/AAAAAAAAMTE/MbznSwo_vFYEAWIEDXmZCNkNUFNkjhLiwCLcBGAs/s1600/intercourse.png https://books.google.com/books?id=aaklGZAID08C&pg=PA932&lpg=PA932&dq=in+jewish+law,+if+an+adult+man+has+intercourse+with+a+forbidden+relative+who+is+more+than&source=bl&ots=MO92IUV0Vt&sig=EY94E3I1_o58VKBvE9y2uE8oNxc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk6pHVvcrUAhUCSCYKHeH2BZcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false https://books.google.com/books?id=aaklGZAID08C&pg=PA932&lpg=PA932&dq=in+jewish+law,+if+an+adult+man+has+intercourse+with+a+forbidden+relative+who+is+more+than&source=bl&ots=MO92IUV0Vt&sig=EY94E3I1_o58VKBvE9y2uE8oNxc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk6pHVvcrUAhUCSCYKHeH2BZcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Just know that is okay for Francis to judge his child abusing priests only when he has to defend his beloved Orthodox Judaism. https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M_swO8yOoRI/WVa9Vz27rWI/AAAAAAAAMZs/DrmmT0jrARILKRu_xcQjI3c3GLoQy7PtwCLcBGAs/s1600/Pope-Francis-preaching-crop%2B%25281%2529.jpg http://callmejorgebergoglio.blogspot.com/search/label/sexual%20abuse%20%26%20clergy": {} }
{ "pp4x": {}, "Ephemeral": {}, "1603742208.0": {}, "“Hitler repeatedly stressed that one could not get at the masses with arguments, proofs and knowledge, but only with feelings and beliefs. In the language of National Socialism, in that of Keyserling, Driesch, Rosenberg, Stapel, etc., the nebulous and the mystical are so conspicuous that an analysis of this peculiarity (what peculiarity do you see?) will certainly prove profitable. What was it in the mysticism of fascism that so fascinated the masses?” -Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism “If it were revolutionary propaganda’s cardinal task **‘to undeceive the proletariat’**, this could not have been done solely by appealing to their ‘class consciousness’, nor solely by constantly impressing upon them the objective economic and political situation, and certainly not by constantly exposing the frauds that had been practiced on them (for generational centuries). The first and foremost task of revolutionary propaganda should have been to give the contradictions in the workers the most sympathetic consideration, to grasp the fact that it was not a clear revolutionary will that was concealed or befogged, but that the revolutionary impulse in the psychic structure of the proletariat was partially undeveloped (the mystical side of life?) and partially interfused with contrary reactionary structural elements (Meme and memetics?). The distillation of the revolutionary sentiments of the broad masses is undoubtedly the basic task in the process of awakening their social responsibility.” -Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism This article could not be written if the truth of these to quotes was not present. Both parties play on emotional content and belief more than facts and data supporting said facts. What the fuck does "make America great again" or "hope and change" mean other than emotional stimulation of what ever the mind receiving such platitudes and vapid statements makes of these campaign slogans based in the receiver's already established beliefs. ...WHAT IS IT IN THE MYSTICISM (OF VAPID CAMPAIGN SLOGANS) THAT SO FASCINATES THE MASSES?": {} }

If Trump's only action in 4 years would've been nothing more than to call out fake news in full view of the world and at rallies, serving as a whipping post that exposes media, then that single action alone is already revolutionary in the scale of an accomplishment. There are a lot of low IQ people (besides the shills) who don't appreciate how much additional time Trump has afforded Americans by spurring the redpilling of tens of millions of people. I know some who went from not being aware of how globalist media compulsively lies, and being dumb consumers of Hollywood, into being aware. Waking up in record time. Because of Trump.

The bigger crimes do faaaaaar more damage, and when there's less big crime the little people do better and need to commit crime less. But that's assuming they're private. If all our banks where nationalized we could quite easily keep a public log of transactions, or at the very least have it audited on a regular basis. Furthermore, any crimes that happen in a public bank is a public issue, and reflects quite poorly on elected officials, who may very well be voted out in the next election, should they take part in any corruption. This is obviously assuming we've already solved the corruption problem, which has to come first and foremost. We can't do *anything* until the cronies are out. > Cryptos are bottom up alternative solutions to centralized currency (that sadly can also be bought up/out). You already noted the problem with this: it can be bought up. Some rich whales could go in and start buying up all the cryptos, and then all the sudden it's top-down. That's what happened with Bitcoin. It also experienced severe deflation, which while increasing the value of individual bitcoins can cause turmoil in a real economy. [Geoffrey Michael, Investopedia, The Dangers Of Deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-dangers-of-deflation.aspx) > Nationalizing the banks will never happen I wouldn't say never. It would require a lot of work, but if we want to fix the system we have to fight the bankers tooth and nail anyways. > We need to decentralize the banks - by supporting local banks and ensuring they won't ever sell out (trusts, credit unions, cooperatives, etc). Yes, I believe that credit unions are the solution. I believe that we need strong public banks, but credit unions should be more common and deal with day-to-day banking. But we can still have decentralized public banks. I believe that we should empower the states to have their own banks. The US is way too big to just have one, big, central bank. We can have a central bank, but it has to be small. > Regional banks won't let their money be used somewhere else - so it stays in the community. This is a reason why I support state banks. It's also why I support regional currencies. If the states decide they don't want to use the US dollar, they should be allowed to use something else, or if they decide they want both the dollar and something, that should be their choice to make. > In the US, only one state bank has managed to survive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_North_Dakota. That's because private banks have been starving them to death! They don't want the People to be in control of their lives — no, they want to enserf us with debt, they want to make us into debt slaves! The only solution is to outright ban private banking institutions. They have to go. Cryptocurrency would only help private banks, at the expense of breeding crime and degeneracy.

I will not vote for any candidate, Republican or Democrat, who is pro-choice. My understanding is that pro-choice means that a woman can choose to keep her unborn baby or choose to have that baby killed. Let’s not sugarcoat this by saying that it has to do with a woman’s right to control her own body. We are not just talking about a woman’s body. There is another human body involved here — the unborn child. Those who agree with the pro-choice view on legal abortion agree that it’s OK to murder an unborn human being. While I am concerned about other issues in this election, nothing could be more important than protecting human life. I cannot vote for anyone who takes a pro-choice stance, period. This includes state Sen. Judy Schwank. Abortion is the leading cause of death in the United States (862,320 in 2017, according to the most recent Guttmacher Institute statistics), followed by heart disease and cancer. We must elect pro-life candidates on every level and end this national carnage. Tom Taylor Caernarvon Township": {} }

The Democrats aim to pack the Supreme Court with leftist ideologues who will produce their long-sought "living constitution" that will allow imposition of any law. Similarly, the Democrats aim to guarantee perpetual power for themselves by packing the electorate, granting citizenship and thus voting rights to millions of illegal aliens. Their aim is to change America from a multi-party democratic constitutional republic to a permanent one-party all-powerful state. Freedom of speech and religion will be replaced by the cancel culture. Firearms will be confiscated, leaving to the tender mercies of well-armed criminals and leftist rioters — those not rich enough or important enough to have professional armed security. Free enterprise prosperity will be replaced by socialist/communist poverty, science and common sense by leftist dogma, an independent America by globalist control, a colorful diverse world by Communist Chinese domination. It's all Obama's "profound change" come true. Cancel America. There's no room in such a leftist dystopia for those of us who think for ourselves and question authority. So we vote for Trump. It's peculiar that the role of preserving the greatest, freest, sweetest land in history, the great experiment in democracy, the world's last best hope, falls to a fellow like Donald Trump. But he's done a remarkable job despite a bureaucracy permeated by his opponents' minions, a skein of turncoat lieutenants, perpetually hostile media and popular culture, and a "peaceful-transfer-of-power" three-and-a-half-year-long attempt to hobble and overthrow him. They hate him because he stands in their way. Unlike the many who have risked and given their lives to win or preserve the freedom that we enjoy, now that it's our turn, we don't even have to risk our lives. All we have to do is vote.

Sociologist Michèle Lamont argues that Jacques Derrida, for example, achieved prominence “by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers,” while “in America, professional institutions and journals played a central role” in the diffusion of postmodernism. Christopher Lord has recently shown how Derrida’s signature incomprehensibility allowed nascent area studies departments to camouflage bold, unchallengeable assertions in “poetic nonsense,” thus obviating the need for traditional scholarship. As Lord reminds us, the primary enthusiasm for postmodernism was not found within philosophy departments, but in the safe spaces of Women’s Studies and Comparative Literature, freed from the confines of classical disciplines and exempted from dead white male standards. This gambit was called out at the time by Camille Paglia, who saw the importation of obscure French postmodernist thought as mere pretentious gloss to mark out people’s resumes. Noam Chomsky later criticized the cult-like insularity of the postmodernists, their irrelevance to lived experience and their abandonment of the oppressed to demagogues, even while they are, according to Chomsky, “quick to tell us that they are far more radical than thou.” Meanwhile, the careerism that Paglia and Chomsky derided had become a necessity, especially within the humanities and social sciences, due to prevailing economic realities.": {} }

Fulbright also opposed McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee and later became known for his opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. His efforts to establish an international exchange program eventually resulted in the creation of a fellowship program which bears his name, the Fulbright Program. >Fulbright claimed that $5 million tax-deductible from philanthropic Americans was sent to Israel and then recycled back to the U.S. for distribution to organizations seeking to influence public opinion in favor of Israel.[61] That statement led to friction with organized pro-Israeli groups in the U.S. >Frustration with the ability of the Zionist Organization of America and other Zionist lobby groups to influence senators with their campaign contributions led Fulbright to retort on Face the Nation on April 15, 1973, "Israel controls the U.S. Senate."[62] "The Senate is subservient to Israel, in my opinion much too much. We should be more concerned about the United States interest rather than doing the bidding of Israel. This is a most unusual development." >Perhaps his most notable case of dissent was his public condemnation of foreign and domestic policies, in particular, his concern that right-wing radicalism, as espoused by the John Birch Society and the wealthy oilman H. L. Hunt, had infected the U.S. military.[citation needed][64] He was, in turn, denounced by Republican Senators J. Strom Thurmond and Barry Goldwater. Goldwater and Texas Senator John Tower announced that they were going to Arkansas to campaign against Fulbright,[65] but Arkansas voters re-elected Fulbright. >Fulbright's career was somewhat stunted, with its influence never matching its luminescence. For all his seniority and powerful committee posts, he was not considered part of the Senate's inner circle of friends and power brokers. He seemed to prefer it that way: the man who Harry S. Truman had called an "overeducated SOB" was, in the words of Clayton Fritchey, "an individualist and a thinker," whose "intellectualism alone alienates him from the Club" of the Senate.[67] >On July 11, 1973, during a speech at an American Bankers Association meeting, Fulbright criticized Capitol Hill attempts to block trade concessions to the Soviet Union until it allowed the emigration of Jews and other groups: "Learning to live together in peace is the most important issue for the Soviet Union and the United States, too important to be compromised by meddling — even idealistic meddling — in each other's affairs." This was what former CIA director Smith and then JFK and now Fulbright believed. That the military should only be used when all diplomatic options are used up and only when the nation, more specifically, its people are threatened with great harm. The neocon/Zionist propaganda due crowd aligned with the CIA felt otherwise. That detente and diplomacy were weakness. Truman was a Freemason; Gigliotti, a Protestant Freemasonic Zionist preacher who mingled with the Likudniks convinced Truman to fire the former CIA smith because he made it a mere caricature of what Gigliotti thought it should be. That it is its own military. Hence, JFK said the CIA should be splintered into a thousand pieces. #Is this making sense? ": {} }
{ "ppxh": {}, "Jesus": {}, "1603846389.0": {}, "#Part 3 Here's the kicker; if we take the people's word, we get a Kennedy that did not like a lot of political Jews: >According to Harvey Klemmer, who served as one of Kennedy’s embassy aides, Kennedy habitually referred to Jews as “kikes or sheenies”. Kennedy allegedly told Klemmer that “[some] individual Jews are all right, Harvey, but as a race they stink. They spoil everything they touch.” When Klemmer returned from a trip to Germany and reported the pattern of vandalism and assaults on Jews by Nazis, Kennedy responded, “Well, they brought it on themselves.” >On June 13, 1938, Kennedy met with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, in London, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy had told him that “it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [Kennedy] himself fully understood our Jewish policy.” Kennedy’s main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh. >Kennedy had a close friendship with Viscountess Nancy Witcher Langhorne, wife of Viscount Waldorf Astor of the Astor family. The correspondence between them is reportedly replete with anti-Semitic statements. According to Edward Renehan: >As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these “world problems” (Nancy’s phrase)….. Kennedy replied that he expected the “Jew media” in the United States to become a problem, that “Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles” were already making noises contrived to “set a match to the fuse of the world”. >By August 1940, Kennedy worried that a third term as the President for Roosevelt would mean war. As Leamer reports, “Joe believed that Roosevelt, Churchill, the Jews, and their allies would manipulate America into approaching Armageddon.” Nevertheless, Kennedy supported Roosevelt’s third term in return for Roosevelt’s promise to support Joseph Kennedy Jr. in a run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1942. However, even during the darkest months of World War II, Kennedy remained “more wary of” prominent American Jews, such as Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, than he was of Hitler. Kennedy told the reporter Joe Dinneen: >It is true that I have a low opinion of some Jews in public office and in private life. That does not mean that I….. believe they should be wiped off the face of the Earth….. Jews who take an unfair advantage of the fact that theirs is a persecuted race do not help much….. Publicizing unjust attacks upon the Jews may help to cure the injustice, but continually publicizing the whole problem only serves to keep it alive in the public mind. – In the recently published Journals: 1952-2000 of the late American historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.: >A MONTH after Kennedy's election, Schlesinger recorded in his diary a resume of his conversations with the president-elect. The central topic was the task of shaping the new administration. When they reached the subject of who would be secretary of state, the name of David Bruce, a veteran diplomat, was mentioned, but Schlesinger thought he would "not have too many ideas of his own." >Later, at Kennedy's house, the president-elect talked favorably about senator J.W. Fulbright. For Kennedy, the influence of Fulbright in the Senate "seemed a paramount consideration." **Schlesinger asked Kennedy if Fulbright would not "alienate the negroes and the Jews?" and Kennedy said, "I don't care about the Jews" [in this connection].** >A few days later, Schlesinger learned that the apparent candidate would be Dean Rusk, who was ultimately nominated. In early December 1960 Schlesinger noted that Harris Wofford (one of Kennedy's advisers) had "succeeded in stirring up the Negroes and Jews so effectively that the uproar killed Fulbright, who was apparently Jack's (Kennedy) first choice." >It appears that Fulbright never forgot his defeat. [According to a pro-Israel Jewish Telegraphic Agency writer.] >The next reference to Fulbright and Israel appears in April 1973. Schlesinger was flying to Palm Beach Florida, and he found that Fulbright and his wife were on board. Here is what Schlesinger recorded of the conversation with the senator: >>Fulbright "began by talking about the Middle East. He is fed up to the teeth with the immensely successful Israeli lobbying operation in the Senate... Senator Jackson could rely on about 80 votes in the Senate for any Israeli issue. The other day Fulbright had a couple of Arab diplomats for lunch. He asked a number of senators; most made excuses; one said he would come by after luncheon but did not; and only three or four accepted." >**What an obsessed scoundrel was this Fulbright.** >On January 9, 1975, Schlesinger met senator George McGovern, who was pondering whether to seek the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on the Middle East. Fulbright had personally held this chairmanship himself, "in order, as he told McGovern, to prevent its falling into the hands of someone who would be too responsive to the Israeli lobby, and he has encouraged McGovern to take it on." >On June 11, 1981 Schlesinger lunched with the prominent journalist **Joe Alsop.** **The topic was "the sneak Israeli attack on the nuclear installation in Iraq, an appalling action" in Schlesinger's view; but he recorded that Bill Paley, president of CBS, and Alsop, the Wall Street Journal and even Schlesinger friend's the liberal journalist Jim Wechsler applauded the attack. When Kissinger was asked his view at a dinner party, he said, "Privately, I am pleased. I think many Arabs are pleased."** Wat??? >At a party in April 1982, Kissinger told Schlesinger that he had "much less sympathy for Nixon now than he had in 1974-75. 'What really finished it for me was the trip to Sadat's funeral,'" when Kissinger went along with Nixon, Ford and Carter. As soon as they got into the plane, "Nixon was his old self again, trying to manipulate everybody and everything, dropping poisonous remarks, doing his best to set the people against each other." >When they were later in the car without Nixon, former president Ford said to Kissinger: "Sometimes I wish I had never pardoned that son of a bitch." Now what about this Alsop? >It is on record, thanks to Kennedy insider Arthur Schlesinger (A Thousand Days: John Kennedy in the White House, 1965), that the two men who convinced Kennedy to take Johnson as his running mate, were Philip Graham and Joseph Alsop, respectively publisher and columnist of the Washington Post, and strong supporters of Israel.[52] Schlesinger doesn’t reveal Graham and Alsop’s arguments, and states that Kennedy’s final decision “defies historical reconstruction”—a curious statement for a historian so well informed on the topic. Johnson was not someone that Kennedy had affection for before, during or after the election. Prior to the 1960 convention he and Johnson were bitter rivals for the nomination. Kennedy was 43 and a Catholic, Johnson was 51 and a Prostestant, so they were also at odds on religious and age fronts. When Kennedy chose Johnson it was a surprise to many in the Democratic establishment and was seen as an attempt to to “win party unity and new strength below the Mason-Dixon Line by choosing the Texan” >As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am going to spend more and more time toward making government service an honorable career.

But this is simply not the case. Criminal statutes, the primary source of liability and punishment in this country, often fail to live up to this commitment to moral guilt. In a surprisingly large number of situations, our nation’s lawmakers have disregarded traditional mens rea principles in favor of a tough-on-crime approach that sacrifices our intuitive sense of fairness in pursuit of an amorphous idea of “public safety.” > > The drug arena is a case in point, in part because it is where some of the most aggressive tough-on-crime campaigns have been waged. U.S. drug policies often focus on behavior to the near total exclusion of mental state considerations. Many drug possession statutes apply a “strict liability” approach, in which—as Markus Dubber explains—“you can be convicted . . . if you don’t know that you are ‘possessing’ a drug of any kind, what drug you are ‘possessing,’ how much of it you’ve got, or—in some states—even that you are possessing anything at all, drug or no drug.” > > Just as strict is the ruthlessly quantitative approach to drug sentencing employed in most jurisdictions that bases punishment on what Doug Berman calls “fairly arbitrary questions about how the drugs involved in an offense are to be classified or quantified instead of on a defendant’s actual culpability.” What this means, in practice, is that small-time dealers can be punished just as severely as big-time traffickers (think decades, not years) based upon their tangential connection to massive quantities of narcotics they had no idea existed and had no intent to sell.": {} }

Cierpi na to wielu mężczyzn, chociaż nie wszyscy się do tego przyznają. Nie jest to jednak nic wstydliwego, ponieważ może mieć bardzo zróżnicowane podłoże. Ratunkiem dla panów mogą być różne techniki relaksacyjne, ćwiczenia czy też po prostu stosowanie odpowiednio dobranych preparatów. Bardzo ważne jest to, aby ostateczny wpływ na ich wybranie miał specjalista. Poradzenie sobie z tego typu problemem wymaga od zainteresowanych czasu i zaangażowania. Ważne jest także to, aby nie skrywać swojego problemu i nie nakładać na siebie dodatkowego obciążenia psychicznego. Panowie powinni porozmawiać o kłopocie ze swoją partnerką i móc liczyć na jej pełne wsparcie. Niestety nie w każdej relacji tak właśnie jest.
