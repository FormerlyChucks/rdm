Communist subversives since the early 20th century have infiltrated and subverted the church placing futurism, homosexuality and degeneracy above "The Way." Of course, the church was always corrupt but don't bash everyone in the church.

Much of this story is surrounded in sensationalism. You'll read blogs that the CIA and Nazis were involved and shot and buried children in "Holocaust style mass graves."

One of his most notorious abusers involved, DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET (baptized Joseph-Maurice-Stanislas; name change?) who had transferred orphans to psychiatric hospitals to secure federal funding, which was more generous for hospitals than for orphanages. Healthy children were diagnosed as mentally unfit and sent to mental hospitals. In some instances, such as Mont-Providence, entire orphanages were reclassified as psychiatric institutions.

Serving mammon to the fullest, what a disgusting sinner and those who were involved in the Catholic church. 

I'm told the Catholic Church was and is corrupt and that Jesuits were all communists. Then why did the Catholic Church (as a whole, or elements within it?) work with Duplessis? In 1937, he introduced An Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda, called the Padlock Act, which prohibited printing or publishing any document (including newspapers and pamphlets) that promoted communism. He sounds more like a Roy Cohn to me than anything else. Remember, Herzl dispised diaspora Jews with such disdain that he attacked them and called them dirty and disgusting kikes. 

Duplessis did, however, call for the emigration of Jews to Canada, during WW2, however, he did it under the auspices that his opposition were communist Jews.

With regards to the Nazi connections, I've found a few other references to this story from Canadian news.

Duplessis orphans want Mtl. burial site dug up. An article that claims that the survivors believe there is a mass grave, also claims that the unclaimed bodies of orphans were sold to medical schools for $10 each, as per Canadian law. Note: neither of the two sites make any claims about Nazis or the CIA.

#Pedophiles and the Vatican 
___

Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and registered sex offender who served 13 months in jail from 2009 to 2010, with Ghislane Maxwell meets Saint John Paul II in an undated photo at Epstein’s home.

https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UrS7MDFQQvw/V4gTbNnVJCI/AAAAAAAAJfs/IBix0ZLccwgJrG4XAhS1DZqjjCSPerCHgCLcB/s400/Jeffrey%2BEpstein%2Bjohn%2Bpaul%2Bii.jpg

Epstein rubbed shoulder with a who’s who of the elite in the world at his private Caribbean island and Palm Beach home where they stayed as his guests. It is rumored he ran a pedophile sex ring stocked with underage children. Names included in his black book which surfaced are: Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Bill Richardson, Leslie Wexner, Mark Katzenellenbogen, Elie Weisel, Edward de Rothschild, Evelyn de Rothschild, David Rockefeller, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Henry Kissinger, Peter Soros, John Kerry, Ernst Hanover, Marie Hapsburg, Prince Andrew (of the United Kingdom), Viscount William Astor, Lord Alistair McAlpine, John Micklethwait, Ghislaine Maxwell, Laurie Oppenheim, Eric Margolis, Peter Mandelson, Constantine Niarchos, Kevin Maxwell, Jose Azna, Prince Salman (of Saudi Arabia), Edward Kennedy, Edgar Bronfman, Ehud Barak, Courtney Love, etc...

One would think that John Paul II would have had handlers or priests who had contacts with police or intelligence services that would have notified him of the less than stellar reputation of Jeffrey Epstein.  Then again, maybe he knew.  After all in 1990 John Paul awarded Jimmy Savile papal knighthood by making him a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KCSG) and he gained further Vatican honors when the Sovereign Military Order of Malta awarded him The Order pro Merito Melitensi.  Allegations had swirled around Savile and complaints were made to law enforcement officers.   The first complaint was a male claiming in 1963 to have been raped by Jimmy.  Was there no one doing due diligence at the Vatican?

Knight Commander Jimmy Savile and Saint John Paul II

“Many dress up as Christians but are not really Christians.”  How apt!  Jesus the Christ said, “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you shall know them...so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the bad tree bringeth forth bad fruit...Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.” (Matthew 7, 15-20)

The key difference between the myriad of cases where Francis has decided not to judge & defrock priests and the case of Mauro Inzoli was simply what one of the victims said on the witness stand.  The English speaking  Novus Ordo religious media has not reported on this one aspect because it is an embarrassment to their bosses.  The Israeli media has said of the testimony, “There is no such ritual in the Old Testament or in Judaism.”  Why then is there an unspoken tradition of sexually abusing minors in Orthodox Judasim?  Many yeshivas of the ‘elder brothers’ are rife with pederasty.  In March of this year, twenty Orthodox males in Jerusalem were arrested for sexually abusing children.  Why does the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics by Rabbi Avraham Steinberg, who was recently appointed by Francis to the Pontifical Academy of Life, say that it is okay for a man to have sexual relations with a boy under the age of nine?  Where there is smoke, there is fire.

Just know that is okay for Francis to judge his child abusing priests only when he has to defend his beloved Orthodox Judaism.

  "“Hitler repeatedly stressed that one could not get at the masses with arguments, proofs and knowledge, but only with feelings and beliefs. In the language of National Socialism, in that of Keyserling, Driesch, Rosenberg, Stapel, etc., the nebulous and the mystical are so conspicuous that an analysis of this peculiarity (what peculiarity do you see?) will certainly prove profitable.  What was it in the mysticism of fascism that so fascinated the masses?” 
-Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism


“If it were revolutionary propaganda’s cardinal task **‘to undeceive the proletariat’**, this could not have been done solely by appealing to their ‘class consciousness’, nor solely by constantly impressing upon them the objective economic and political situation, and certainly not by constantly exposing the frauds that had been practiced on them (for generational centuries). The first and foremost task of revolutionary propaganda should have been to give the contradictions in the workers the most sympathetic consideration, to grasp the fact that it was not a clear revolutionary will that was concealed or befogged, but that the revolutionary impulse in the psychic structure of the proletariat was partially undeveloped (the mystical side of life?) and partially interfused with contrary reactionary structural elements (Meme and memetics?).  The distillation of the revolutionary sentiments of the broad masses is undoubtedly the basic task in the process of awakening their social responsibility.”
-Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism


This article could not be written if the truth of these to quotes was not present.  Both parties play on emotional content and belief more than facts and data supporting said facts.

If Trump's only action in 4 years would've been nothing more than to call out fake news in full view of the world and at rallies, serving as a whipping post that exposes media, then that single action alone is already revolutionary in the scale of an accomplishment.

  "> Big banks help big criminals get away with crimes. Crime will happen. The bigger crimes do faaaaaar more damage, and when there's less big crime the little people do better and need to commit crime less.

But that's assuming they're private. If all our banks where nationalized we could quite easily keep a public log of transactions, or at the very least have it audited on a regular basis. Furthermore, any crimes that happen in a public bank is a public issue, and reflects quite poorly on elected officials, who may very well be voted out in the next election, should they take part in any corruption.

This is obviously assuming we've already solved the corruption problem, which has to come first and foremost. We can't do *anything* until the cronies are out.

> Cryptos are bottom up alternative solutions to centralized currency (that sadly can also be bought up/out).

You already noted the problem with this: it can be bought up. Some rich whales could go in and start buying up all the cryptos, and then all the sudden it's top-down. That's what happened with Bitcoin.

It also experienced severe deflation, which while increasing the value of individual bitcoins can cause turmoil in a real economy. [Geoffrey Michael, Investopedia, The Dangers Of Deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-dangers-of-deflation.aspx)

> Nationalizing the banks will never happen

I wouldn't say never. It would require a lot of work, but if we want to fix the system we have to fight the bankers tooth and nail anyways.

> We need to decentralize the banks - by supporting local banks and ensuring they won't ever sell out (trusts, credit unions, cooperatives, etc).

Yes, I believe that credit unions are the solution. I believe that we need strong public banks, but credit unions should be more common and deal with day-to-day banking.

But we can still have decentralized public banks. I believe that we should empower the states to have their own banks. The US is way too big to just have one, big, central bank. We can have a central bank, but it has to be small.

> Regional banks won't let their money be used somewhere else - so it stays in the community.

This is a reason why I support state banks. It's also why I support regional currencies. If the states decide they don't want to use the US dollar, they should be allowed to use something else, or if they decide they want both the dollar and something, that should be their choice to make.

> In the US, only one state bank has managed to survive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_North_Dakota.

That's because private banks have been starving them to death! They don't want the People to be in control of their lives — no, they want to enserf us with debt, they want to make us into debt slaves! The only solution is to outright ban private banking institutions. They have to go.

Cryptocurrency would only help private banks, at the expense of breeding crime and degeneracy. Bitcoin is largely used to pay for drugs, murder, trafficking, and other horrible stuff.": {}

While it's too late to do much about organizing SaidIt, I do love the idea of classifying subs like your example.  It may be useful for the next iteration of SaidIt that /u/magnora7 and/or /u/d3rr may do.  I doubt anyone would voluntarily consider themselves an echo chamber but folks might consider classifying their subs into things like /a/Audio, /c/Community, /g/Genre, /i/Images, /m/Media, /p/Political, /t/Topic, /v/Video, /w/Website, etc. (ideally pre-determined democratically by a next-gen dev team or discussion sub).

I have only 3 suggestions if you do revisions.  Make the year HUGE (so you can read it in your periphery while watching the map), make the legend much bigger, and make the legend static (don't have colours popping on and off).

-
Bonus ideas: Add some copyleft background music, add a sliding time bar, make slower or faster versions, and maybe consider more revisions building it out in years to come and back in time.

Sadly it got overlooked.  Worth the effort IMO.  And I think you could repost again and again in other subs until it gets noticed.  I think if they knew it was by you it would make a difference.  Consider this as a post title:

I animated countless TV ads, 15 or 30 seconds long, sometimes done in a week, sometimes one spot would take 3 months.  Why?  For the love of the craft and for the paycheck.  Why did I give it up?  I learned there was more to life than just glossy shit that no one needs.

> But the judge refused to reinstate Denton to his position, finding that he was so loathed by his colleagues for his religious views that he couldn’t effectively serve as president.

> The Student Supreme Court at FSU had other ideas. In a ruling Monday, the five justices overturned the June 5 vote of no-confidence and ordered Denton’s reinstatement as senate president, finding him the victim of “unconstitutional retaliation.”
> 
> The “long-term interest in protecting the values of the First Amendment” is “undeniable,” the court said: If it didn’t reinstate Denton (above), “the message this sends on behalf of our Student Government Association, as well as our University, is that some views are okay to share, and some are not.”

A very good letter.
-------------------------------------------------

I am a registered Republican and pro-life. I will not vote for any candidate, Republican or Democrat, who is pro-choice. My understanding is that pro-choice means that a woman can choose to keep her unborn baby or choose to have that baby killed.


Let’s not sugarcoat this by saying that it has to do with a woman’s right to control her own body. We are not just talking about a woman’s body. There is another human body involved here — the unborn child. Those who agree with the pro-choice view on legal abortion agree that it’s OK to murder an unborn human being.


While I am concerned about other issues in this election, nothing could be more important than protecting human life. I cannot vote for anyone who takes a pro-choice stance, period. This includes state Sen. Judy Schwank.


Abortion is the leading cause of death in the United States (862,320 in 2017, according to the most recent Guttmacher Institute statistics), followed by heart disease and cancer. We must elect pro-life candidates on every level and end this national carnage.

  "How wonderfully delusional. 
------------------------------------


They're calling it the "Cancel America" election.

The Democrats aim to pack the Supreme Court with leftist ideologues who will produce their long-sought "living constitution" that will allow imposition of any law. Similarly, the Democrats aim to guarantee perpetual power for themselves by packing the electorate, granting citizenship and thus voting rights to millions of illegal aliens.

Their aim is to change America from a multi-party democratic constitutional republic to a permanent one-party all-powerful state. Freedom of speech and religion will be replaced by the cancel culture. Firearms will be confiscated, leaving to the tender mercies of well-armed criminals and leftist rioters — those not rich enough or important enough to have professional armed security. Free enterprise prosperity will be replaced by socialist/communist poverty, science and common sense by leftist dogma, an independent America by globalist control, a colorful diverse world by Communist Chinese domination. It's all Obama's "profound change" come true. Cancel America.

There's no room in such a leftist dystopia for those of us who think for ourselves and question authority.

So we vote for Trump. It's peculiar that the role of preserving the greatest, freest, sweetest land in history, the great experiment in democracy, the world's last best hope, falls to a fellow like Donald Trump. But he's done a remarkable job despite a bureaucracy permeated by his opponents' minions, a skein of turncoat lieutenants, perpetually hostile media and popular culture, and a "peaceful-transfer-of-power" three-and-a-half-year-long attempt to hobble and overthrow him.

They hate him because he stands in their way.

Unlike the many who have risked and given their lives to win or preserve the freedom that we enjoy, now that it's our turn, we don't even have to risk our lives. All we have to do is vote.

God bless America. God save America.

  "[Yaniv targets beauty pageant in new discrimination complaint
](https://archive.vn/1RMtO)
> 
> Yaniv has male genitals and was born a biological male, but now self-identifies as female. In May 2019, Yaniv applied to be a contestant in the Pageant, and was tentatively accepted. Yaniv did not mention being transgender prior to applying. At the time, Canada Galaxy Pageants had a formal policy of accepting genetic females as contestants, but would still accept transgender females who had fully transitioned and no longer had male genitals. This policy was noted in all paperwork and on the website. The pageant’s policy has since been revised to include “genetic females and fully transitioned.”
> 
> All of the contestants, including girls as young as six, change their clothing and undress in common areas. No males, including contestants’ fathers, are allowed in that space, to protect the privacy and comfort of the contestants. Contestants from teens and up also compete in a swimwear category.
> 
> Once reminded of the pageant’s policy, Yaniv filed a human rights complaint against Canada Galaxy Pageants, alleging discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sex, in violation of the Ontario Human Rights Code. Yaniv is seeking damages in the amount of $10,000 for “injury to dignity and feelings,” and requests that the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario rule that an organization cannot refuse a service to someone just because that person has male genitalia.": {}

People are getting tired of American music - k-pop is becoming internationally popular (and the k-pop industry is literally like a slave industry). Culture and music were things America used to do right, and influenced the world with them. Now we’re being influenced by the word’s music and other cultures.

Trap influenced British Trap, now British Trap (take Skepta for example), is influencing American rap. It’s happening everywhere. America doesn’t feel like “the producer” anymore.

Ale niepokój o dwie lub trzy filiżanki dziennie, a nawet więcej zanika, ze względu na to, że wciąż pojawiają się nowe wyniki badań sugerujące korzyści zdrowotne wynikające z picia kawy. W 2011 roku naukowcy informowali, że picie kawy wiąże się z: mniejszym ryzykiem depresji wśród kobiet, mniejszym ryzykiem śmiertelnego raka prostaty u mężczyzn, czy mniejszym ryzykiem udaru u mężczyzn oraz kobiet. Ponadto w innych badaniach można znaleźć również informacje o korzystym wpływie kawy przy: chorobie Parkinsona, cukrzycy oraz niektórych rodzajach raka. Kofeina była badana częściej niż jakikolwiek inny składnik kawy i bardzo często przypisuje się jej bardzo korzystny wpływ na ludzki mózg. Ale nie należy również zapominać o tym, że kawa zawiera dosłownie tysiąc innych różnych substancji, które są bardzo często odpowiedzialne za prozdrowotne właściwości w innych częsciach naszego ciała.

 $200 Billion liquidation is only 12% of Amazon's market cap. 

If all liquidated at once it would temporarily drop Amazon to $2,866 which investors would gobble up as quickly as it is sold. 

I say they should get both equity and wage. $150K is enough to buy a modest home in most locations. I guess that's discussion for a union later.

  "[Beyond Postmodern: The Neoliberal Roots of Woke Cancel Culture](https://archive.vn/NdAAa)

>Sensing an opportunity, a coterie of 1980-90s faculty used postmodernist posturing to help them acquire positions in a dwindling academic marketplace. Sociologist Michèle Lamont argues that Jacques Derrida, for example, achieved prominence “by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers,” while “in America, professional institutions and journals played a central role” in the diffusion of postmodernism. Christopher Lord has recently shown how Derrida’s signature incomprehensibility allowed nascent area studies departments to camouflage bold, unchallengeable assertions in “poetic nonsense,” thus obviating the need for traditional scholarship. As Lord reminds us, the primary enthusiasm for postmodernism was not found within philosophy departments, but in the safe spaces of Women’s Studies and Comparative Literature, freed from the confines of classical disciplines and exempted from dead white male standards. This gambit was called out at the time by Camille Paglia, who saw the importation of obscure French postmodernist thought as mere pretentious gloss to mark out people’s resumes. Noam Chomsky later criticized the cult-like insularity of the postmodernists, their irrelevance to lived experience and their abandonment of the oppressed to demagogues, even while they are, according to Chomsky, “quick to tell us that they are far more radical than thou.” Meanwhile, the careerism that Paglia and Chomsky derided had become a necessity, especially within the humanities and social sciences, due to prevailing economic realities.": {}

No, I meant… extract the transcript from whatever weird XML / JSON format YouTube serves it to the client as.

> Then you _ARE_ a SCHILL, intentionally ignoring evidence to be ignorant ON PURPOSE.

I said that it probably wouldn't convince me – _not_ that I would ignore it. It was a prediction, not a declaration of intent; sorry for the vagueness. A more detailed explanation of my intent: Unless you think that this video contains _all_ the reasons you think that way, laid out with enough (externally-verifiable) evidence to support all the necessary claims (which I wouldn't know, since I don't know what's in it), it wouldn't make me as certain as you are – and that might not be enough certainty to think it more likely than not (my standard for “convinced”). It'd probably make me _more_ certain (I've already [updated on that probably](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Conservation_of_expected_evidence), but I think you'd think, given what I know about what I know, that knowing what the video says will make me more certain still, which is the correct thing to think if you have a justified reason to be more sure about how much the contents of the video will persuade me (e.g. knowing what the video says, and having the contents of the video containing a lot of persuasive evidence).)

The fact you believe something isn't enough for me to believe it. Plenty of people around me believe all sorts of things, but them believing them isn't _strong_ evidence for them. Yeah, if I refused to _watch_ it because it was an “unreliable source”, _that'd_ be pompous…

> I don't know what you mean with your Stallman reference, beyond the obvious: The sky is falling and no one cares.

Pretty much. But unlike Cassandra, you're not cursed; just not as good at convincing people as you'd need to be. For most of your claims (probably a superset of the ones I agree with you about… I'm just not sure _which_ are the extra ones), you _have_ enough information to convince other people, but your presentation isn't good enough.

> We're in a manufactured crisis scamdemic while propaganda, shills, idiots, and sheeple refuse to see their world collapsing into this totalitarian "new normal" tyranny bullshit.

That's just one of the issues. Yeah, [it's important](https://xkcd.com/2368/), but other people might care more about different ones. Imo, your aim shouldn't be to try to convince people; it should be to foster the behaviour that prevents this from happening. Go a level below (or above… not sure what the proper metaphorical direction is).

Other than my occasional ventures over to Saidit, I don't _need_ to know who's doing what, what the latest plot to hurt everyone is, who's chucking barrels of DDT into the ocean. All I need to do is behave in a way that makes that stuff slightly less effective. The only reason I come here is to check whether that still lines up with what you think – because as hard as it is for me to believe some of the things you're saying, [_in the past_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction) you've known better than I what needs to be done (even if you haven't explicitly identified it). (More than I can say for _some_; you're one of the ~five Saiditors I actually respect.)

> I've always been curious about that book, but not enough to read it. Maybe I'm naive or pretending I'm too virtuous or something, but it seems like it might be a slimy manipulation gimmick manual for used car salesmen and desperate horny men.

This is why:

>Full bright was for the United Nations at the time and was a signatory to the Southern Manifesto. Fulbright also opposed McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee and later became known for his opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. His efforts to establish an international exchange program eventually resulted in the creation of a fellowship program which bears his name, the Fulbright Program. 

>Fulbright claimed that $5 million tax-deductible from philanthropic Americans was sent to Israel and then recycled back to the U.S. for distribution to organizations seeking to influence public opinion in favor of Israel.[61] That statement led to friction with organized pro-Israeli groups in the U.S. 

>Frustration with the ability of the Zionist Organization of America and other Zionist lobby groups to influence senators with their campaign contributions led Fulbright to retort on Face the Nation on April 15, 1973, "Israel controls the U.S. Senate."[62] "The Senate is subservient to Israel, in my opinion much too much. We should be more concerned about the United States interest rather than doing the bidding of Israel. This is a most unusual development."

>Perhaps his most notable case of dissent was his public condemnation of foreign and domestic policies, in particular, his concern that right-wing radicalism, as espoused by the John Birch Society and the wealthy oilman H. L. Hunt, had infected the U.S. military.[citation needed][64] He was, in turn, denounced by Republican Senators J. Strom Thurmond and Barry Goldwater. Goldwater and Texas Senator John Tower announced that they were going to Arkansas to campaign against Fulbright,[65] but Arkansas voters re-elected Fulbright. 

>Fulbright's career was somewhat stunted, with its influence never matching its luminescence. For all his seniority and powerful committee posts, he was not considered part of the Senate's inner circle of friends and power brokers. He seemed to prefer it that way: the man who Harry S. Truman had called an "overeducated SOB" was, in the words of Clayton Fritchey, "an individualist and a thinker," whose "intellectualism alone alienates him from the Club" of the Senate.[67]

>On July 11, 1973, during a speech at an American Bankers Association meeting, Fulbright criticized Capitol Hill attempts to block trade concessions to the Soviet Union until it allowed the emigration of Jews and other groups: "Learning to live together in peace is the most important issue for the Soviet Union and the United States, too important to be compromised by meddling — even idealistic meddling — in each other's affairs."

This was what former CIA director Smith and then JFK and now Fulbright believed. That the military should only be used when all diplomatic options are used up and only when the nation, more specifically, its people are threatened with great harm. The neocon/Zionist propaganda due crowd aligned with the CIA felt otherwise. That detente and diplomacy were weakness. 

Truman was a Freemason; Gigliotti, a Protestant Freemasonic Zionist preacher who mingled with the Likudniks convinced Truman to fire the former CIA smith because he made it a mere caricature of what Gigliotti thought it should be. That it is its own military. Hence, JFK said the CIA should be splintered into a thousand pieces.

Here's the kicker; if we take the people's word, we get a Kennedy that did not like a lot of political Jews:


>According to Harvey Klemmer, who served as one of Kennedy’s embassy aides, Kennedy habitually referred to Jews as “kikes or sheenies”. Kennedy allegedly told Klemmer that “[some] individual Jews are all right, Harvey, but as a race they stink. They spoil everything they touch.” When Klemmer returned from a trip to Germany and reported the pattern of vandalism and assaults on Jews by Nazis, Kennedy responded, “Well, they brought it on themselves.”

>On June 13, 1938, Kennedy met with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, in London, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy had told him that “it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [Kennedy] himself fully understood our Jewish policy.” Kennedy’s main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh.

>Kennedy had a close friendship with Viscountess Nancy Witcher Langhorne, wife of Viscount Waldorf Astor of the Astor family. The correspondence between them is reportedly replete with anti-Semitic statements. According to Edward Renehan:

>As fiercely anti-Communist as they were anti-Semitic, Kennedy and Astor looked upon Adolf Hitler as a welcome solution to both of these “world problems” (Nancy’s phrase)….. Kennedy replied that he expected the “Jew media” in the United States to become a problem, that “Jewish pundits in New York and Los Angeles” were already making noises contrived to “set a match to the fuse of the world”.

>By August 1940, Kennedy worried that a third term as the President for Roosevelt would mean war. As Leamer reports, “Joe believed that Roosevelt, Churchill, the Jews, and their allies would manipulate America into approaching Armageddon.” Nevertheless, Kennedy supported Roosevelt’s third term in return for Roosevelt’s promise to support Joseph Kennedy Jr. in a run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1942. However, even during the darkest months of World War II, Kennedy remained “more wary of” prominent American Jews, such as Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, than he was of Hitler.

Kennedy told the reporter Joe Dinneen:

>It is true that I have a low opinion of some Jews in public office and in private life. That does not mean that I….. believe they should be wiped off the face of the Earth….. Jews who take an unfair advantage of the fact that theirs is a persecuted race do not help much….. Publicizing unjust attacks upon the Jews may help to cure the injustice, but continually publicizing the whole problem only serves to keep it alive in the public mind. – 

In the recently published Journals: 1952-2000 of the late American historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.:

>A MONTH after Kennedy's election, Schlesinger recorded in his diary a resume of his conversations with the president-elect. The central topic was the task of shaping the new administration. When they reached the subject of who would be secretary of state, the name of David Bruce, a veteran diplomat, was mentioned, but Schlesinger thought he would "not have too many ideas of his own."

>Later, at Kennedy's house, the president-elect talked favorably about senator J.W. Fulbright. For Kennedy, the influence of Fulbright in the Senate "seemed a paramount consideration." **Schlesinger asked Kennedy if Fulbright would not "alienate the negroes and the Jews?" and Kennedy said, "I don't care about the Jews" [in this connection].**




>A few days later, Schlesinger learned that the apparent candidate would be Dean Rusk, who was ultimately nominated. In early December 1960 Schlesinger noted that Harris Wofford (one of Kennedy's advisers) had "succeeded in stirring up the Negroes and Jews so effectively that the uproar killed Fulbright, who was apparently Jack's (Kennedy) first choice."

>It appears that Fulbright never forgot his defeat. [According to a pro-Israel Jewish Telegraphic Agency writer.]

>The next reference to Fulbright and Israel appears in April 1973. Schlesinger was flying to Palm Beach Florida, and he found that Fulbright and his wife were on board. Here is what Schlesinger recorded of the conversation with the senator:

>>Fulbright "began by talking about the Middle East. He is fed up to the teeth with the immensely successful Israeli lobbying operation in the Senate... Senator Jackson could rely on about 80 votes in the Senate for any Israeli issue. The other day Fulbright had a couple of Arab diplomats for lunch. He asked a number of senators; most made excuses; one said he would come by after luncheon but did not; and only three or four accepted."

>**What an obsessed scoundrel was this Fulbright.**

>On January 9, 1975, Schlesinger met senator George McGovern, who was pondering whether to seek the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee's subcommittee on the Middle East. Fulbright had personally held this chairmanship himself, "in order, as he told McGovern, to prevent its falling into the hands of someone who would be too responsive to the Israeli lobby, and he has encouraged McGovern to take it on."

>On June 11, 1981 Schlesinger lunched with the prominent journalist **Joe Alsop.** **The topic was "the sneak Israeli attack on the nuclear installation in Iraq, an appalling action" in Schlesinger's view; but he recorded that Bill Paley, president of CBS, and Alsop, the Wall Street Journal and even Schlesinger friend's the liberal journalist Jim Wechsler applauded the attack. When Kissinger was asked his view at a dinner party, he said, "Privately, I am pleased. I think many Arabs are pleased."**

Wat???

>At a party in April 1982, Kissinger told Schlesinger that he had "much less sympathy for Nixon now than he had in 1974-75. 'What really finished it for me was the trip to Sadat's funeral,'" when Kissinger went along with Nixon, Ford and Carter. As soon as they got into the plane, "Nixon was his old self again, trying to manipulate everybody and everything, dropping poisonous remarks, doing his best to set the people against each other."

>When they were later in the car without Nixon, former president Ford said to Kissinger: "Sometimes I wish I had never pardoned that son of a bitch." 



Now what about this Alsop?

>It is on record, thanks to Kennedy insider Arthur Schlesinger (A Thousand Days: John Kennedy in the White House, 1965), that the two men who convinced Kennedy to take Johnson as his running mate, were Philip Graham and Joseph Alsop, respectively publisher and columnist of the Washington Post, and strong supporters of Israel.[52] Schlesinger doesn’t reveal Graham and Alsop’s arguments, and states that Kennedy’s final decision “defies historical reconstruction”—a curious statement for a historian so well informed on the topic.

Johnson was not someone that Kennedy had affection for before, during or after the election.

Prior to the 1960 convention he and Johnson were bitter rivals for the nomination. Kennedy was 43 and a Catholic, Johnson was 51 and a Prostestant, so they were also at odds on religious and age fronts. When Kennedy chose Johnson it was a surprise to many in the Democratic establishment and was seen as an attempt to to “win party unity and new strength below the Mason-Dixon Line by choosing the Texan”



>As Mr. Kennedy sat in the rocker in my office, his head resting on its back he placed his left leg across his right knee. He rocked slightly as he talked. In a slow pensive voice he said to me, 'You know if I am re-elected in sixty-four, I am going to spend more and more time toward making government service an honorable career. I would like to tailor the executive and legislative branches of government so that they can keep up with the tremendous strides and progress being made in other fields.' 'I am going to advocate changing some of the outmoded rules and regulations in the Congress, such as the seniority rule. To do this I will need as a running mate in sixty-four a man who believes as I do.' Mrs. Lincoln went on to write "I was fascinated by this conversation and wrote it down verbatim in my diary. Now I asked, 'Who is your choice as a running-mate?' 'He looked straight ahead, and without hesitating he replied, 'at this time I am thinking about Governor Terry Sanford
of North Carolina. But it will not be Lyndon.'

>Indeed, according to an unpublished memoir by Hyman Raskin, a Chicago lawyer and political operative whom Hersh cites, Kennedy was forced to pick then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate in 1960 when Johnson and his fellow Texan, then-House Speaker Sam Rayburn, threatened to divulge some unidentified episode from Kennedy’s past. “Those bastards [Johnson and Rayburn] were trying to frame me,” Raskin claimed Kennedy told him. “They threatened me with problems, and I don’t need more problems. I’m going to have enough problems with Nixon.”

And what about this nice Jewish Arthur Schlsinger Jr. historian:

>"In defense of the world Order, U.S. soldiers would have to kill and die. ... We are not going to achieve a New World Order without paying for it in blood, as well as in words and money."

-- Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in Back to the Womb, July/August 1993 issue of Foreign Affairs ": {}

  "[How Criminal Law Lost Its Mind](https://archive.vn/jIr9G)

> If legal rhetoric were an accurate gauge of legislative reality, our criminal justice system’s treatment of mens rea would be pristine. But this is simply not the case. Criminal statutes, the primary source of liability and punishment in this country, often fail to live up to this commitment to moral guilt. In a surprisingly large number of situations, our nation’s lawmakers have disregarded traditional mens rea principles in favor of a tough-on-crime approach that sacrifices our intuitive sense of fairness in pursuit of an amorphous idea of “public safety.”
> 
> The drug arena is a case in point, in part because it is where some of the most aggressive tough-on-crime campaigns have been waged. U.S. drug policies often focus on behavior to the near total exclusion of mental state considerations. Many drug possession statutes apply a “strict liability” approach, in which—as Markus Dubber explains—“you can be convicted . . . if you don’t know that you are ‘possessing’ a drug of any kind, what drug you are ‘possessing,’ how much of it you’ve got, or—in some states—even that you are possessing anything at all, drug or no drug.”
> 
> Just as strict is the ruthlessly quantitative approach to drug sentencing employed in most jurisdictions that bases punishment on what Doug Berman calls “fairly arbitrary questions about how the drugs involved in an offense are to be classified or quantified instead of on a defendant’s actual culpability.” What this means, in practice, is that small-time dealers can be punished just as severely as big-time traffickers (think decades, not years) based upon their tangential connection to massive quantities of narcotics they had no idea existed and had no intent to sell.": {}

Yes, a new path is required.  We humans have tried Authoritative, socialism, fascism, communism, oligarchy, Military, Industrial, Religious, economic complexes, democracy and a few others over written narrative history (~5,500 years).  We have tried revolution (spinning in a circle about a never changing hub cutting off elites heads), riots, rallies, special interests by the thousands with signs to prove it...don't pick a side any more, because this as we are today is conquered because divided already.  Where do Union, where do we become one within mind and behavior that shares this planet within equanimity?   

The only thing I might see as different than you opinion posted is to expand the save our home to all of Earth.  Yet, by the means you state, find a new fucking way.

Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions, which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.
- Albert Einstein
 
The significant problems we face today cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.
- Albert Einstein

How to find your way by Buckminster Fuller:

The things to do are: the things that need doing: that you see need to be done,
and that no one else seems to see need to be done. Then you will conceive your own way
of doing that, which needs to be done --that no one else has told you to do or how to do it.
This will bring out the real you that often gets buried inside a character that has acquired a
superficial array of behaviors induced or imposed by others on the individual.”

Another problem I've ran into is that I have to reload the map every time I make changes, so for about half a second the screen is blank. There's nothing I can do about that since it's not my code.

I also decided to make a dictionary of functions (if I used values it would be much larger) that change the color of every state and just copy-paste it with whatever changes are needed. It's not ideal, but it's the only solution I could think of.

I could just put in what was changed, but I realized doing that would be a big hassle because it has to work both ways round. If I copy-paste it I can just work backwards.

I've programmed in 2016-2020, and I don't know if I should go ahead and release it, and add more dates over time, or wait until the entire data-set is there. A lot of game developers have open betas, and this would kind of be like that.

As I said, attention whore. I grew up before the vapid social media bullshit that has so warped young minds into seeking the approval of strangers on the internet. Yay, you got likes, good on YOU. you are so clever, so meaningful, so fucking worthwhile. Those of us who value content, not praise, generally run multiple accounts in order to be able to express multiple viewpoints without enabling the woke to trail through history in order to derail.

-------------------------------

Ohio Republicans have been infected by the unscrupulous, duplicitous President Donald Trump virus, spreading voter suppression tactics to Republican election officials across our country. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s ‘mask’ is not working. His Trump fever (detected by the court) clumps ballot-receiving boxes all together, in one location not easily reached by Democratic voters. This becomes virulent, insidious voter suppression, not far removed from the nefarious tactics foreign adversaries and domestic terrorist traitors might try to destabilize our country and democracy.

Because our state is still so gerrymandered, Republican Party officials in Ohio have not been held accountable -- so it’s likely we all will pay electric bills in January including nuclear subsidy charges from House Bill 6. Republican Sen. Rob Portman’s vote will make sure we lose health care and pre-existing conditions protections in January.

Republicans have forgotten how to be servants of we the people, of all of us. Vote as if democracy depends on us, because it does.

It's just that for 98% of people under 70, they'll be fine. 90% of people between 70 and 80 will be fine. And if you're over 80 or have another health condition like cancer, you should be very cautious. 

A big survey about 3 months ago found that people under 40 generally believed that if they got the virus, death was imminent. This isn't true.. It wasn't true then,  it wasn't true in march, it's not true now. But if you try to tell them that, they will rage against you. This is atheism at it's core and this woman is merely following it's scriptures and principles, virtuous scientism.

I think caution is warranted. But you don't quarantine the healthy.. You don't lock everyone up and tell them to wear a mask that doesn't do anything. In a real pandemic, you're not stocking up on toilet paper, they're using toilet paper for kindling for the mass graves.

Powinniśmy jednak unikać kupowania ich w marketach, gdyż bardzo łatwo zasugerować się niską ceną i nabyć produkt, który w składzie może zwierać polepszacze smaku bądź konserwanty. Jeśli chcemy być pewni, iż kupujemy soki bądź konfitury, które w stu procentach składają się ze składników naturalnych, powinniśmy zaopatrzyć się u producenta. Jakie produkty z owoców powinny znaleźć się w naszej spiżarni? Źródło: https://www.biotrendy.pl/lifestyle/soki-dzemy-i-syropy-3-rodzaje-przetworow-owocowych-ktore-powinnismy-miec-w-spizarni/": {}

How does one teach another the critical thinking skills required to move past binary decision making?

I think that antifa has been doing a good job in doing the active part of Fascism. It is like being anti-violence, but starting physical fights when someone has a different opinion than you.

There are also ideas about being better than the others. In Fascism this is usually about the Nation and/or Race.  
That nationalism aspect is replaced with "Social Justice",  that is indeed borrowed from Marxism and  
mixed with modernism. The Racist aspect is the Critical Race Theory.

So that is why I call them Masked Fascists. They are acting like fascists, but have different ideas about what is right and wrong. And because their ideas are so confusing, they are just puppets of the media. I think that Karl Marx would be very angry with them.

The problem is that people are tribalist: they wish to find a group which they can align with and one which they can align against. In the US the tribes are Democrats and Republicans. The only way to prevent our Nation from falling apart is to redefine the tribes. We must make the Nation the in-group, and our enemies, such as the PRC, the out-group.

I meant whites mixing with other whites. As in Russians mixing with Germans for example.

>We are indeed siblings. 

So you genetic ancestry is European?

>White Americans are largely raceless.

No, they're not. The overwhelming majority of white Americans are not mixed with other races. Their genetic ancestry is almost entirely European.

>White Americans can be fit very loosely into the Caucasian category, along with Middle-Eastern/Mediterranian folk and North Indians. 

That's a categorization based on skull shapes, I'm talking about genetics. Whites are Europeans.

>I'm probably more Caucasian than you are. 

That's possible, but you're not more European than me.

>White Americans are a hodgepodge of highly diverse Caucasian groups who can scarcely identify which of the many white races they are actually comprised of.

Again, this is nonsense. White Americans are overwhelmingly European.

>Jews tend to be the less mixed Caucasian elements, which suggests why mongrel ethnonationalist Americans tend to have such a problem with them. 

First of all, Jews are less European than white Americans, and secondly, we have problems with them because they're trying to replace us in all our nations. And white Americans are only mongrels in terms of mixed European heritage.": {}

-----------------------------


U.S. Border Patrol officials privately worried they could face jail time for their roles in President Trump’s since-scrapped policy to separate migrant children from their parents, according to emails released Thursday amid renewed scrutiny over the family-shattering practice.

The emails were included in a House Judiciary Committee report summarizing its 21-month probe into the Trump administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy, which required Border Patrol agents to split up thousands of mostly Central American families who illegally crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in 2017 and 2018.

In one email dated June 4, 2018, a Border Patrol supervisor in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley wrote to a subordinate that a local federal judge had been “very upset” in a court hearing and ordered the agency to “keep constant track of the children once they are separated from their parents and when and where they are reunified.”

“This is going to be a huge headache, I might be spending some time in the slammer,” the supervisor wrote followed by a sad-face emoji.

The subordinate, a Border Patrol enforcement agent, responded: “I ain’t going to jail!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

The names of the Border Patrol officials were blacked out in the committee report.": {}

  "Thanks for the offer, I appreciate it. I strongly think I'll be launching a couple more sites over the next few months. 

> Their expectations of the site didn't match reality and that's 100% a saidit problem for not clearly communicating.

I agree expectations didn't match reality. I don't think it was a problem of communication though, I think it was a problem of having opposing goals that were logically conflicting at the root.  

Saidit tried to be both the catch-all reddit alternative, and also the higher-quality place that wasn't voat. And these worked for a while but it led to this thing where some see saidit as purely the former, and some see it as purely the latter. And so some people's expectations were broken when I leave up things that go against the pyramid of debate, and other people who see it as a purely free-speech site have their expectations broken when I remove things that go against the pyramid of debate. So it's like two separate, mutually-exclusive visions trying to happen at once. 

I tried my best to find a happy medium between those two goals, which I long believed was possible, but it ended up kind of just causing the site to suck at both things. The free speech people are worried stuff will be removed, and the pyramid of debate people  are worried that the site culture is going bad. And what sucks is they're both right. So instead of succeeding at finding a happy medium, I think what happened was saidit kind of half-failed and half-succeeded at both goals. 

So I think I have to make sites more catered to each goal individually. And if you want to run the free-speech-focused site, I'd be glad to get out of your way and let you run it. I'm going to make a new site focused hardcore on the pyramid of debate to go strictly for high-quality discussion. And another site that is "no politics" since I see that requested a ton. 

I'm honestly still confused about why ruqqus blew up so quick after it launched. But their alexa rank is doing the same thing as ours right now, we're really peers in the same boat, at about the same level. I do think they paid for reddit advertising though, they generated word of mouth in a way I was never able to despite my best efforts. Maybe the flashy new site design helps too. Maybe they happened to have better timing of their launch. I don't know, honestly. But if we step back and reevaluate like you suggest, I think making more sites with more focused goals on each site seems to be a clear way forward, and I think would probably re-invigorate public interest in the saidit software project as well.": {}

if drug use and possession and manufacture were not criminal offenses, anybody could grow their own marijuana and would therefore probably not be so willing to give a hundred bucks to some deranged gangster for a handful of shrubs..

drugs are only profitable to the criminals because they are the only ones that are willing to face the criminal penalties.

your move.

another angle, another reason that the manufacture of drugs is regulated is to prevent ordinary people from manufacturing their own diabetic meds and their own pain meds and their own antibiotics.. yes, i do believe that there are many people that probably know quite a bit about how to manufacture these substances, but they just dont have the moxy to navigate thru the fda redtape.

That's because the "muh freeze peech" trolls you should've been removing, that effectively spam the place with the lowest possible quality of content, are the exact same Voat trolls that drove away anyone interesting from Voat in the first place as well. You should have strictly stuck to the concept of a pyramid of debate and immediately shown those people the door, but in spite of repeated insistent requests to do so you didn't.

Why you ever thought you'd be able to tolerate such a hostile userbase while also pretending to have a pyramid of debate still baffles me. The answer was clear from the start: They don't care, they're actively here to trash the place, go back to Voat. You chose not to. This isn't just "trying to do two things at opposite ends", this is actively bending the knee to a particular kind of user that just wants to have yet another place to fling poo from. You flatly just did not enforce what ANYONE expected from the central thesis you published in the FAQ, and as a result almost everyone who actually cared about that up and left after REPEATEDLY requesting you enforce it and your REPEATED refusal to do so, until it bit you in the ass the exact way everyone warned you it would.

Basically the question is this: Why would anyone care about your future or ongoing projects when it's clear from **this one** you refuse to enforce your own website guidelines the moment something gets popular?

Rather than open in spring 2021, the galleries have chosen to delay “until a time at which we think that the powerful message of social and racial justice that is at the center of Philip Guston’s work can be more clearly interpreted”.

  "As longtime advocates for transparency when it comes to money in politics and political advertising, we are concerned by the actions taken by Facebook this month against researchers at NYU. Although we have a lot more information about advertising online thanks to platform ad libraries, we also know that what is available is far from sufficient to investigate some of the most important questions about targeting and influence, which is why we are calling for universal digital ad transparency. There is a role for third-party auditing of online libraries, and we urge Facebook to work with and take seriously the concerns of independent researchers working in the public interest.

If he were to sell his shares at once it would be a temporary hit to the value of the shares as a whole. So 88% - if it was all liquidated into cash vs share transfer - of $3257 is $2866.16

Those who exploit us and withhold the fruits of our work from us will not willingly give up their wealth and power. To carve out autonomous territory, or to begin the revolutionary process, goods, land, and tools must be expropriated, or taken away from those who withhold them."

I mean, it seems pretty weird that rich people are protesting themselves right?  "Oh my god, I hate myself for not giving up my second home!  I need to go loot some stores to feel better about it!"

If you watch the Flat Earth documentary, you can see that the kinds of people who get caught up in these movements, and end up staying with them even when it's nonsensical, do so because it's their complete identity - not necessarily because they believe in what it stands for.  They like the sense of belonging, and they might even an important voice in their movement.  So if the movement ends, where does that leave them?

A total smear to excuse that Joe is the most *ON RECORD* racist politician we have, but yesterday on reddit "But barack chose him, so he cant be racist". 

Here's joe being called out for his racism (BEFORE HE WAS NOMINATED).   https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/07/05/joe-bidens-alternative-white-reality/

Joe also called poor black children "Roaches" on tv.... which is an [anti-black slur](http://www.racialslurs.net/slur/roach). 


Nonetheless, Actors and actresses have historically been chosen for their magnificent intellects, like Lindsay Lohan.  

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


>Ice Cube was forced to defend himself from criticism after it was revealed he was working with the White House to incorporate parts of his own organisation, Contract with Black America, into the Platinum Plan.

It's funny how when both parties are screwing us over, one party (even pretending) to work with the people is BAD.  Maybe thats a sign that the entire media has been corrupted by for profit interests. 

I'm trying to see what the dems have done through this pandemic, after the first relief bill and leader going on tv and saying 'its coming its coming its coming' then months later saying they wont do anything *IF TRUMP HAS HIS NAME ON THE CHECK*. 

So both parties are playing games with our lives and only one has a 4+ outlet strong pravda to back them up with this kind of utter propo.  But yes. joe is 'not' a racist. 




When you search for joe biden controversies, there are hundred results "explaining" that they are ok, can you imagine seeing that many results for the Trumpf 'explaining' any of his comments?  Or is this a partisan smear job? 

^ When Tara Reade came out with her tale of Joe Biden physically assaulting her, the entire media was silent.  Only a few indie journalists who had their own publications reported it, and all of the mainstream media ignored it. 

Outlets like MSNBC ran pieces to criticise THE VICTIM instead of sharing her story.  Democrats who said "BELIEVE ALL WOMEN" now said "JOE IS INNOCENT, BELIEVE ONLY SOME WOMEN"

The democrats are as crooked as the neocons in the bush administration, hence why [all of them are now supporting joe](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/more-100-former-aides-john-mccain-endorse-biden-president-n1238393). 

>“They all lie and they all cheat but we can’t afford not to negotiate with whoever is in power or our condition in this country will never change. Our justice is bipartisan.”

THIS is the real reason for all these tards trying to censor uppity black folk like Ice Cube and Wayne ("You're not black!" -Biden), thinking for themselves and telling people that the democrats are just as destructive as the repubs is being turned into untruth, unable to be said, without the sayer becoming unpersoned and smeared.

Oh, I guess I'm an idiot then. All I did was type in the URL, and it wasn't capitalized there, so I just assumed, like an idiot, that it wasn't capitalized at all. I didn't even know that tool existed — I should have searched for it before speaking. Thanks for pointing that out, I marked-out that section of my comment.

Why would I lie? If I was banned from Reddit, I'd be proud and embrace it. The more the leftists and CCP hate me the better!

> The last comment made was in the /r/futureofdixie subreddit

Looking through that sub gives me the impression that it's a leftist alternative to r/dixie, which seems to be pretty deep in the lost cause, neo-Confederate stuff. All I did was scroll on the front pages for a few seconds, so maybe I'm wrong.

> you also moderate /s/dixie.

s/dixie isn't like r/futureofdixie, it's more similar to r/dixie. It's not a leftist sub, and is open for anyone to discuss their ideas freely.

You can probably assume both me and that user are from Dixie, but using that as evidence to say we're the same person is absurd. The South has a population of over one-hundred-million — more than Germany. You wouldn't say that just because two people are from Germany that they're the same person, would you?

> The account seems to have made 6 comments, all of which were in anti-reddit subreddits.

I don't think r/futureofdixie is anti-reddit from looking at it. It seems to be leftist, at least to some extent — but all the comments where complaining about a subreddit being banned.

> Shitting on reddit is a common thing in your saidit account.

Doesn't everyone on Saidit shit on Reddit? (Except the shills.) Saidit was literally made as an alternative to Reddit, so naturally people here don't like it. Doesn't mean every single person who doesn't like Reddit was banned there. I also shit on other platforms like Twitter, Discord, SnapChat, and TikTok, so are you going to say I was banned from those platforms too? Anyone who pays attention can obviously see that I shit on the entirety of mainstream tech, and prefer alt-tech whenever possible. I'm also very anti-CCP, and a lot of my criticisms come from these companies's ties with China.

I also want to say that, upon you giving me this information, that it doesn't look like my unique writing style. This is probably the best argument against it being me.

One big problem is that they say "4" instead of "four". I always write-out numbers, with the obvious exception being dates, years, and the like.

Another issue is that they don't capitalize "liberalism" — I always capitalize the names of ideologies: they're proper nouns.

Punctuation is a problem: I use a lot of em dashes and colons, which they simply don't do. They also used a hashtag in one of their posts, which I absolutely hate doing. I'll use some on YouTube and Gab, but only because it increases exposure. Using hashtags on Reddit, Saidit, or any similar site is just dumb — it literally doesn't do anything.": {}

  "Pure cruelty.
-----------------------------------


Ernest Porter spent 33 years in a 7-by-12-foot cell with a roughly 6-inch-wide window. He was allowed out for 10 hours a week — but leaving the cell meant being strip searched and then shackled. Exercise meant time spent in a cage, alone or with one other prisoner.


That was life on death row in Pennsylvania state prison. And Porter’s was among the longest solitary-confinement stints on record, though his death sentence was vacated in 2003.


But now, Porter, 59, and six other prisoners have been moved out of death-row solitary into general population, following a precedent-setting 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in September that found the conditions violated the Eighth Amendment’s protection against cruel and unusual punishment.


It is the latest in a series of recent rulings that have forced the state to dismantle traditional death-row solitary confinement by moving prisoners up for resentencing into general population and reforming treatment of those who continue to face execution. Last year, the state significantly increased out-of-cell time and other quality-of-life measures for those on death row, though the coronavirus pandemic subsequently put the entire state system on effective lockdown.

Porter was convicted of fatally shooting South Philadelphia beauty shop owner Raymond F. Fiss, Jr., 52, during a 1985 robbery. The crime inflamed racial tensions in the community, where outraged white residents rallied and marched on City Hall.

While federal courts previously found that a prisoner whose death sentence was vacated can’t be kept on death row, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC) argued that didn’t apply to those whose proceedings had been stayed in federal court.


A DOC spokesperson declined to comment.

Prison officials have argued death-sentenced inmates pose a danger to general population because they have “nothing left to lose.” But Porter’s lawyers said he’s maintained a perfect disciplinary record — even as his mental health has deteriorated in isolation, causing “severe anxiety, depression, panic, paranoia, bipolar mood swings, and at times suicidal impulses,” according to his court filing.

Now, Porter’s complaint against the prison will return to federal district court for a possible civil trial. The DOC argued in briefings it should not have to pay damages: “Because no prior case from this court — or any other court — clearly established the wrongfulness of the DOC’s interpretation, qualified immunity shields the DOC officials from liability.”

Isolation on death row has drawn increasing criticism, amid a mounting number of exonerations involving cases in which the death penalty was threatened or imposed — including 13% of convictions overturned last year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.": {}

  "More of the War on the Police.
----------------------------

A Black trooper with the Louisiana State Police was on a break when his cellphone buzzed with an unusual voice message. It was from a white colleague, unaware his Apple Watch had recorded him, blurting out the Black trooper’s name followed by a searing racial slur.

“F----- n----, what did you expect?”

That unguarded moment, sent in a pocket-dial of sorts, touched off an internal investigation at Louisiana’s premier law-enforcement agency that remained under wraps for three years before a local television station reported last month that the white trooper had not even been reprimanded for the racist recording.

“I believe this to be an isolated incident and I have great confidence in the men and women who serve in the Louisiana State Police,” the agency’s outgoing head, Col. Kevin Reeves, said in response to the controversy.


But an Associated Press review of hundreds of State Police records revealed at least a dozen more instances over a three-year period in which employees forwarded racist emails on their official accounts with subject lines like “PROUD TO BE WHITE,” or demeaned minority colleagues with names including “Hershey’s Kiss,” “Django” and “Egg Roll.”

“The State Police has a real, deep-rooted racism problem,” said David Lanser, a New Orleans attorney with the Law Office of William Most, which obtained the records and emails through a targeted public-records request in 2018 for emails containing racist language. “Denying the existence of systemic and individual racism in the LSP will only serve to perpetuate its serious and often tragic effects on the people of Louisiana.”

Reeves, who abruptly retired this week amid a series of controversies involving race, did not respond to a detailed request for comment. A State Police spokesman said only that “these incidents were already addressed by the agency.”

On Friday, Gov. John Bel Edwards appointed a Black State Police captain, Lamar Davis, to succeed Reeves, who is white.

Law enforcement misconduct — especially cases involving bias — has drawn new scrutiny amid a racial reckoning sweeping the country after the killing of George Floyd.

In Louisiana, racial tensions have heightened in recent months amid a federal civil rights investigation into the still-unexplained death of Ronald Greene, a Black motorist taken into custody last year following a State Police chase near Monroe. Reeves faced criticism for his secretive handling of the case, including waiting 474 days to open an internal probe and refusing to release body-cam video that, according to those who have seen it, shows troopers beating, choking and dragging Greene while calling him a “son of a b----.”

  "Those are extremely inaccurate polls, but the reason is now tactical. Reason at the end.

Reason for bad polling data:

Trump has more support now than before. Almost every Trump voter I know doesn't answer polls and is constantly aware of the chilling effect of tarred and feathered in public for being a Trump supporter, so most of them just keep their mouths shut and pretend to be on the sidelines. And even despite the widespread persecution of Trump supporters, there are still millions willing to go public and attend rallies.

Reason it's tactical now:

Some the big players know the polls are as wrong or worse than in 2016. They reason they pretend otherwise and claim "more accurate now" and keep that rhetoric in the media is because they want to use it as the basis to challenge the results if anything is close. It's easier to rig an election with switching out ballots and then pointing to fake "legitimate" polls that back you up than it is to rig it and point to polls that accurately reflect Trump will win in swing states if people turn out to vote. The same circular way that the New York Times will cite some hack source and make it the leading story, and then Wikipedia will cite the New York Times.

He shut down travel from China almost immediately. What are you referring to specifically? 

>Biden won't enable Russian espionage attacks and drive all our allies and trade partners toward China like Trump does.

I fail to see that based on Biden's own words and actions. The guy has allegedly used his influence to help his son secure business deals with China and Ukraine. Trump has been anti-China since day 1, I fail to see how your point makes logical sense when he forced harder sanctions on them. Why would he drive more commerce towards China? If you can provide an example here I would love to see it.

  "The Deep state is perception management. I have already posted elsewhere that Neocons are re-branding and I have also posted elsewhere that there are many war-hawks behind Trump. The goal is a re-banding of SOME neocons into a anti-war, pro-constitution protection racket. They know the American people will blame AIPAC and the Jewish community for an Iranian war. How thick headed do you have to be to not see that Trump destroyed the Reform Party in the late 20th and early 21st century and was extremely pro-Bush. He is pro-Israel, pro-Netanyahu. pro-Likud, you know, the terrorist group that orchestrated 9/11–Trump's friends; whom he has pardoned and appointed many in the past 4 years. This is why RT correspondent, of all people, and former PNAC Signee, Michael Maloof, says that Trump is working with Netanyahu to ease propaganda against Iran, at least for the time being. Most of what is going on is unconventional warfare and psychological operations to protect Israel's interests. 

The only thing that could possibly happen now is a false flag in the US blamed on Iran in order to impose unipolarism. If they did 9/11, they'll do something much worse. But again, Israel might be doing something else. They might be signing onto the BRIC alliance and screwing the US whilst remaining in control to suck up the last pennies when the time is ripe. 

Biden surely is pro-War but he was a politican for 40+ years. Trump was a business man and has little voting records other than trolling th ereform party to get Bush elected and being best friends with the ZioCons who orchestrated 9/11. Don't forget Trump has plenty of KGB friends and Jewish Russian oligarchs, so he could be selling out the US. By that I mean, bringing back jobs to the US. How? By lower wages. He got the nod to do this to even the playing field. In the end, you will always lose to a ZioCon Scottish rite Freemason. They are not loyal to the US.

It also teaches us to constanly think about solutions to everyday problems by training attention.

It is my favorite philosophy and trust me I've tried a lot. The "Apathy" that the stoics seek with their training is very similar to the Nirvana of Buddhism. In fact, both philosophies share a lot of themes.

  "> I think it's because they claimed a simple free speech strategy from the get go which attracted a certain reddit crowd which led to marketing success

I wonder though because many other sites did the exact same strategy and didn't catch on like ruqqus did. Like poal, phucks, and notabug. Not sure what set ruqqus apart from all of those. Saidit had a core initial audience from /r/conspiracy and /r/C_S_T from my articles, but I don't know where the core audience came from for ruqqus and how they were so unified and good at getting the word out. 

> How it won't end up exactly like Voat or Voat-light, I don't think they have an answer to and it is likely inevitable. 

I agree, ruqqus is following the same cultural evolutionary arc that voat did. I think eventually they'll culturally settle somewhere between saidit and voat, and their traffic will slowly drop like poal's did.

> Maybe saidit.net should become this new hardcore pyramid of debate site?

From where I'm sitting, I think trying to make a significant change to saidit culture at this point would not go over well and would also be an unnecessary uphill battle. Making a new site would piss off no one, but changing saidit significantly like that would piss off half our userbase. So expanding to new sites seems like the wiser choice, as far as I can see

> About their rank, try comparing US vs. US. Also seeing India as our top country is weird, what if half of our traffic is from a private streaming sub or something?

That is strange... could be watchpeopledie, or gendercritical, or something? Or maybe just lots of people run vpns that go through india? Hired shill groups from india? The mma fights streaming people? Maybe cricket streaming, I used to see that sometimes on saidit. No idea tbh. 


> Maybe there's room for a full frontal conspiracy focused site with free speech? Something like that would be exciting.

I think that's a perfect angle for the free speech site! I love it. I agree there is demand for this. And you don't have to necessarily admin, you can just choose the people to appoint to do the admin work. You can pick them from saidit, and use their post history to vet their intentions. And on a new site, the stakes are lower if one admin goes off the rails, so you can try new admins out without too much risk. So you can be an admin manager rather than an admin. Once you set everything up and the admins are vetted and know what to do, then you could just step back and let it run and not have to do any work at all.

That's my plan with the other sites too. I want to become more of an admin manager, rather than do admin janitor work myself all the time. But this requires clearly-defined rules for the content admins, which is another reason new websites with narrowly-defined focuses would be very useful. ": {}

  ""Court Says Six-Day-Old Baby Isn’t a Person"

God I hate these shitty editorialized titles.

"In an eight-page decision issued Thursday, a five-member majority of the Court of Appeals said in a decision written by Judge Eugene Pigott that the central question in the case was whether the state Legislature intended "to hold pregnant women criminally responsible for engaging in reckless conduct against themselves and their unborn fetuses, such that they should be subject to criminal liability for prenatal conduct that results in postnatal death? Under the current statutory scheme, the answer to this question is no."

The court said that Suffolk County prosecutors "concede that, had defendant not consented to the cesarean section with the result that the child be born alive, she would not have been prosecuted for manslaughter in the second degree." Ruling against Jorgensen, then, "would create a perverse incentive for a pregnant woman to refuse a cesarean section out of fear that if her baby is born alive she would face criminal charges for her alleged reckless conduct, jeopardizing the health of the woman and the unborn fetus."

Such an imposition of criminal liability, the majority found, "should be clearly defined by the legislature, not the courts. It should also not be left to the whim of the prosecutor."": {}

  "Stłuszczeniowa choroba wątroby charakteryzuje się obecnością nieprawidłowej ilości tłuszczu w wątrobie, co nazywa się stłuszczeniem. Jeśli masz tłuszcz w wątrobie, ale nie masz innych uszkodzeń, uważa się, że masz niealkoholową stłuszczeniową chorobę wątroby (NAFLD). Nieleczona może przyczynić się do zapalenia i uszkodzenia komórek wątroby, powodując chorobę zwaną niealkoholowym stłuszczeniowym zapaleniem wątroby (NASH). NASH jest związany z marskością wątroby, schyłkową chorobą wątroby i przeszczepem wątroby i często wiąże się z chorobami układu krążenia. Zmiany w diecie powodujące utratę wagi, dodanie pokarmów bogatych w składniki odżywcze i przeciwutleniaczy, takich jak: owoce i warzywa, mogą odwrócić lub zapobiec postępowi choroby. Utrata masy ciała, szczególnie w obrębie brzucha lub tkanki tłuszczowej, może pomóc w redukcji tłuszczu w wątrobie. Ważne w leczeniu będzie również ograniczenie rafinowanych węglowodanów, cukrów prostych, smażonej, przetworzonej i bogatej w tłuszcze nasycone. Ze względu na to, że stłuszczenie wątroby często wiąże się z otyłością, insulinoopornością, zespołem metabolicznym i zwiększonym ryzykiem chorób układu krążenia, powolna i kontrolowana utrata masy ciała jest jednym z głównych celów.

It is probably easy to get immune with a strong immune system, lots of Vitamin-D,
and maybe the virus is weaker in sunlight.  
So we need more summer parties.

We already know what people are sensitive to the virus, but this is not in the news, because we all need to be scared.  
People that are sensitive, need extra help.  
Now we already have the medicine to help these people pro-actively, with near 100% success.  
Even vitamin D gives 98% success.

If we wanted to save lives, it would have been easy to have some ultra-violet 
tunnels in front of the elder care homes. And prevent people with fevers from getting in,
with simple infra-red scanners. We only need those at the places where people may die from it.

> 
> The Twitter by Morgan on Oct. 28 had a video of the progress of the wall along with the message: “CBP & U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continue to build new wall every day. Every mile helps us stop gang members, murderers, sexual predators, and drugs from entering our country. It’s a fact, walls work.”
> 
> Twitter’s moderators removed the tweet from public view and emailed Morgan, saying, “You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.”
> 
> “The acting commissioner’s tweet did none of these things. Read it. Watch the video,” Wolf told Dorsey in the letter. He also called Twitter’s action “unjustified,” adding that “the tweet is supported by data.”": {}

You climax and give the marine creature's breakfast. The pumping slows down but doesn't stop to milk out the last few drops of its meal.

It would be conceivable, if this were a package bombing, or a shooting.   Terror Shootings have occurred in the past, although many recent events are staged.  
  
For the sake of the argument it is very much conceivable that vulnerable men could be brainwashed to do many crazy things.

The idea that someone would decapitate another person, because they're drawing offensive pictures of a religious figure is absurd.

-----------------------------------

Days after the barbaric beheading of Professor Samuel Paty in the streets of Paris by a terrorist for showing the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad to his students, support continues to flow for the deceased professor.The French people, defying death threats, gathered near a government building in Montpellier on Wednesday to condemn the murder of Samuel Paty. Amid strong security, residents projected huge cartoon images of Charlie Hebdo and images of Samuel Paty on a local government building in symbolic tribute to the late professor.


The images would have been projected on two town halls in the Occitanie region – Montpellier and Toulouse for more than four hours Wednesday evening. Carole Delga, the mayor declared that the decision to project the image was to declare “there must be no weakness in the face of the enemies of democracy, in the face of those who transform religion into a weapon of war … those who intend to destroy the Republic. ”

Paty, a history teacher in the greater Paris area, was assassinated on Friday by a Muslim immigrant terrorist after showing his students caricatures of the prophet of Islam from Charlie Hebdo during a class debate on freedom to expression. A young Muslim stabbed a 47-year-old teacher in the throat while shouting “Allahu Akbar”.

Earlier on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the professor who died beheaded near Paris last week.

During the memorial service at the Sorbonne, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed that France “will not give up cartoons”. He also added that Paty had been killed by “cowards” for representing the secular and democratic values ​​of the French Republic.

Speaking to Twitter, Macron also shared an image of Paty to express his solidarity with the victim of terrorism.": {}

It's anti-Zionist Jews getting silenced because of their ideals. Personally, I think the Jews as Israel should simply divide the country in two if they want to improve the quality of life for Palestinians. I'm not fond of the idea of the two fighting each other or whatever but if they can't let go of their hate, they should at least improve the quality of their rivals for the sake of decency, there's no justification for unarmed Palestinians to get tortured like it has happened many times in the past.
