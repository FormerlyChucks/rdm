You'll read blogs that the CIA and Nazis were involved and shot and buried children in "Holocaust style mass graves." One of his most notorious abusers involved, DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET (baptized Joseph-Maurice-Stanislas; name change?) who had transferred orphans to psychiatric hospitals to secure federal funding, which was more generous for hospitals than for orphanages. Healthy children were diagnosed as mentally unfit and sent to mental hospitals. In some instances, such as Mont-Providence, entire orphanages were reclassified as psychiatric institutions. Serving mammon to the fullest, what a disgusting sinner and those who were involved in the Catholic church. I'm told the Catholic Church was and is corrupt and that Jesuits were all communists. Then why did the Catholic Church (as a whole, or elements within it?) work with Duplessis? In 1937, he introduced An Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda, called the Padlock Act, which prohibited printing or publishing any document (including newspapers and pamphlets) that promoted communism. He sounds more like a Roy Cohn to me than anything else. Remember, Herzl dispised diaspora Jews with such disdain that he attacked them and called them dirty and disgusting kikes. Duplessis did, however, call for the emigration of Jews to Canada, during WW2, however, he did it under the auspices that his opposition were communist Jews. With regards to the Nazi connections, I've found a few other references to this story from Canadian news. Duplessis orphans want Mtl. burial site dug up. An article that claims that the survivors believe there is a mass grave, also claims that the unclaimed bodies of orphans were sold to medical schools for $10 each, as per Canadian law. Note: neither of the two sites make any claims about Nazis or the CIA. #Pedophiles and the Vatican ___ Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted pedophile and registered sex offender who served 13 months in jail from 2009 to 2010, with Ghislane Maxwell meets Saint John Paul II in an undated photo at Epstein’s home. https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UrS7MDFQQvw/V4gTbNnVJCI/AAAAAAAAJfs/IBix0ZLccwgJrG4XAhS1DZqjjCSPerCHgCLcB/s400/Jeffrey%2BEpstein%2Bjohn%2Bpaul%2Bii.jpg Epstein rubbed shoulder with a who’s who of the elite in the world at his private Caribbean island and Palm Beach home where they stayed as his guests. It is rumored he ran a pedophile sex ring stocked with underage children. Names included in his black book which surfaced are: Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Bill Richardson, Leslie Wexner, Mark Katzenellenbogen, Elie Weisel, Edward de Rothschild, Evelyn de Rothschild, David Rockefeller, Rupert Murdoch, Michael Bloomberg, Henry Kissinger, Peter Soros, John Kerry, Ernst Hanover, Marie Hapsburg, Prince Andrew (of the United Kingdom), Viscount William Astor, Lord Alistair McAlpine, John Micklethwait, Ghislaine Maxwell, Laurie Oppenheim, Eric Margolis, Peter Mandelson, Constantine Niarchos, Kevin Maxwell, Jose Azna, Prince Salman (of Saudi Arabia), Edward Kennedy, Edgar Bronfman, Ehud Barak, Courtney Love, etc... https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oKLfz0T74PU/V4g-koJdUyI/AAAAAAAAJgA/qmE2isceq2kCmBGQgx8yi1xfH6E2smktQCLcB/s400/246FAE4700000578-0-image-a-4_1420492905144.jpg One would think that John Paul II would have had handlers or priests who had contacts with police or intelligence services that would have notified him of the less than stellar reputation of Jeffrey Epstein. Then again, maybe he knew. After all in 1990 John Paul awarded Jimmy Savile papal knighthood by making him a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KCSG) and he gained further Vatican honors when the Sovereign Military Order of Malta awarded him The Order pro Merito Melitensi. Allegations had swirled around Savile and complaints were made to law enforcement officers. The first complaint was a male claiming in 1963 to have been raped by Jimmy. Was there no one doing due diligence at the Vatican? https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RK3RcR9ePUQ/V4g_5nAGSlI/AAAAAAAAJgM/HvZnpncexhEiPNO5vP3uHBYt3NBL7ZyegCLcB/s400/Pope-and-Jimmy-Sav_2380825b.jpg Knight Commander Jimmy Savile and Saint John Paul II “Many dress up as Christians but are not really Christians.” How apt! Jesus the Christ said, “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you shall know them...so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the bad tree bringeth forth bad fruit...Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.” (Matthew 7, 15-20) The key difference between the myriad of cases where Francis has decided not to judge & defrock priests and the case of Mauro Inzoli was simply what one of the victims said on the witness stand. The English speaking Novus Ordo religious media has not reported on this one aspect because it is an embarrassment to their bosses. The Israeli media has said of the testimony, “There is no such ritual in the Old Testament or in Judaism.” Why then is there an unspoken tradition of sexually abusing minors in Orthodox Judasim? Many yeshivas of the ‘elder brothers’ are rife with pederasty. In March of this year, twenty Orthodox males in Jerusalem were arrested for sexually abusing children. Why does the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics by Rabbi Avraham Steinberg, who was recently appointed by Francis to the Pontifical Academy of Life, say that it is okay for a man to have sexual relations with a boy under the age of nine? Where there is smoke, there is fire. https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7ZI5GQ9XqOU/WUgTNVn_cgI/AAAAAAAAMTE/MbznSwo_vFYEAWIEDXmZCNkNUFNkjhLiwCLcBGAs/s1600/intercourse.png https://books.google.com/books?id=aaklGZAID08C&pg=PA932&lpg=PA932&dq=in+jewish+law,+if+an+adult+man+has+intercourse+with+a+forbidden+relative+who+is+more+than&source=bl&ots=MO92IUV0Vt&sig=EY94E3I1_o58VKBvE9y2uE8oNxc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk6pHVvcrUAhUCSCYKHeH2BZcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false https://books.google.com/books?id=aaklGZAID08C&pg=PA932&lpg=PA932&dq=in+jewish+law,+if+an+adult+man+has+intercourse+with+a+forbidden+relative+who+is+more+than&source=bl&ots=MO92IUV0Vt&sig=EY94E3I1_o58VKBvE9y2uE8oNxc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjk6pHVvcrUAhUCSCYKHeH2BZcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Just know that is okay for Francis to judge his child abusing priests only when he has to defend his beloved Orthodox Judaism. https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M_swO8yOoRI/WVa9Vz27rWI/AAAAAAAAMZs/DrmmT0jrARILKRu_xcQjI3c3GLoQy7PtwCLcBGAs/s1600/Pope-Francis-preaching-crop%2B%25281%2529.jpg http://callmejorgebergoglio.blogspot.com/search/label/sexual%20abuse%20%26%20clergy": {} }

In the language of National Socialism, in that of Keyserling, Driesch, Rosenberg, Stapel, etc., the nebulous and the mystical are so conspicuous that an analysis of this peculiarity (what peculiarity do you see?) will certainly prove profitable. What was it in the mysticism of fascism that so fascinated the masses?” -Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism “If it were revolutionary propaganda’s cardinal task **‘to undeceive the proletariat’**, this could not have been done solely by appealing to their ‘class consciousness’, nor solely by constantly impressing upon them the objective economic and political situation, and certainly not by constantly exposing the frauds that had been practiced on them (for generational centuries). The first and foremost task of revolutionary propaganda should have been to give the contradictions in the workers the most sympathetic consideration, to grasp the fact that it was not a clear revolutionary will that was concealed or befogged, but that the revolutionary impulse in the psychic structure of the proletariat was partially undeveloped (the mystical side of life?) and partially interfused with contrary reactionary structural elements (Meme and memetics?). The distillation of the revolutionary sentiments of the broad masses is undoubtedly the basic task in the process of awakening their social responsibility.” -Wilhelm Reich The Mass Psychology of Fascism This article could not be written if the truth of these to quotes was not present.

The bigger crimes do faaaaaar more damage, and when there's less big crime the little people do better and need to commit crime less. But that's assuming they're private. If all our banks where nationalized we could quite easily keep a public log of transactions, or at the very least have it audited on a regular basis. Furthermore, any crimes that happen in a public bank is a public issue, and reflects quite poorly on elected officials, who may very well be voted out in the next election, should they take part in any corruption. This is obviously assuming we've already solved the corruption problem, which has to come first and foremost. We can't do *anything* until the cronies are out. > Cryptos are bottom up alternative solutions to centralized currency (that sadly can also be bought up/out). You already noted the problem with this: it can be bought up. Some rich whales could go in and start buying up all the cryptos, and then all the sudden it's top-down. That's what happened with Bitcoin. It also experienced severe deflation, which while increasing the value of individual bitcoins can cause turmoil in a real economy. [Geoffrey Michael, Investopedia, The Dangers Of Deflation](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0311/the-dangers-of-deflation.aspx) > Nationalizing the banks will never happen I wouldn't say never. It would require a lot of work, but if we want to fix the system we have to fight the bankers tooth and nail anyways. > We need to decentralize the banks - by supporting local banks and ensuring they won't ever sell out (trusts, credit unions, cooperatives, etc). Yes, I believe that credit unions are the solution. I believe that we need strong public banks, but credit unions should be more common and deal with day-to-day banking. But we can still have decentralized public banks. I believe that we should empower the states to have their own banks. The US is way too big to just have one, big, central bank. We can have a central bank, but it has to be small. > Regional banks won't let their money be used somewhere else - so it stays in the community. This is a reason why I support state banks. It's also why I support regional currencies. If the states decide they don't want to use the US dollar, they should be allowed to use something else, or if they decide they want both the dollar and something, that should be their choice to make. > In the US, only one state bank has managed to survive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_North_Dakota. That's because private banks have been starving them to death! They don't want the People to be in control of their lives — no, they want to enserf us with debt, they want to make us into debt slaves! The only solution is to outright ban private banking institutions. They have to go. Cryptocurrency would only help private banks, at the expense of breeding crime and degeneracy.

I will not vote for any candidate, Republican or Democrat, who is pro-choice. My understanding is that pro-choice means that a woman can choose to keep her unborn baby or choose to have that baby killed. Let’s not sugarcoat this by saying that it has to do with a woman’s right to control her own body. We are not just talking about a woman’s body. There is another human body involved here — the unborn child. Those who agree with the pro-choice view on legal abortion agree that it’s OK to murder an unborn human being. While I am concerned about other issues in this election, nothing could be more important than protecting human life. I cannot vote for anyone who takes a pro-choice stance, period. This includes state Sen. Judy Schwank. Abortion is the leading cause of death in the United States (862,320 in 2017, according to the most recent Guttmacher Institute statistics), followed by heart disease and cancer. We must elect pro-life candidates on every level and end this national carnage. Tom Taylor Caernarvon Township": {} }

The Democrats aim to pack the Supreme Court with leftist ideologues who will produce their long-sought "living constitution" that will allow imposition of any law. Similarly, the Democrats aim to guarantee perpetual power for themselves by packing the electorate, granting citizenship and thus voting rights to millions of illegal aliens. Their aim is to change America from a multi-party democratic constitutional republic to a permanent one-party all-powerful state. Freedom of speech and religion will be replaced by the cancel culture. Firearms will be confiscated, leaving to the tender mercies of well-armed criminals and leftist rioters — those not rich enough or important enough to have professional armed security. Free enterprise prosperity will be replaced by socialist/communist poverty, science and common sense by leftist dogma, an independent America by globalist control, a colorful diverse world by Communist Chinese domination. It's all Obama's "profound change" come true. Cancel America. There's no room in such a leftist dystopia for those of us who think for ourselves and question authority. So we vote for Trump. It's peculiar that the role of preserving the greatest, freest, sweetest land in history, the great experiment in democracy, the world's last best hope, falls to a fellow like Donald Trump. But he's done a remarkable job despite a bureaucracy permeated by his opponents' minions, a skein of turncoat lieutenants, perpetually hostile media and popular culture, and a "peaceful-transfer-of-power" three-and-a-half-year-long attempt to hobble and overthrow him. They hate him because he stands in their way. Unlike the many who have risked and given their lives to win or preserve the freedom that we enjoy, now that it's our turn, we don't even have to risk our lives. All we have to do is vote.

Sociologist Michèle Lamont argues that Jacques Derrida, for example, achieved prominence “by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers,” while “in America, professional institutions and journals played a central role” in the diffusion of postmodernism. Christopher Lord has recently shown how Derrida’s signature incomprehensibility allowed nascent area studies departments to camouflage bold, unchallengeable assertions in “poetic nonsense,” thus obviating the need for traditional scholarship. As Lord reminds us, the primary enthusiasm for postmodernism was not found within philosophy departments, but in the safe spaces of Women’s Studies and Comparative Literature, freed from the confines of classical disciplines and exempted from dead white male standards. This gambit was called out at the time by Camille Paglia, who saw the importation of obscure French postmodernist thought as mere pretentious gloss to mark out people’s resumes. Noam Chomsky later criticized the cult-like insularity of the postmodernists, their irrelevance to lived experience and their abandonment of the oppressed to demagogues, even while they are, according to Chomsky, “quick to tell us that they are far more radical than thou.” Meanwhile, the careerism that Paglia and Chomsky derided had become a necessity, especially within the humanities and social sciences, due to prevailing economic realities.": {} }

If there's no product market fit and this site doesn't make us happy/fulfilled, then it's time to reevaluate. ": {} }

Please, take a look at the link below. https://saidit.net/s/conspiracy/comments/6piu/the_missing_covid_virus_researchers_can_assemble/ Statistics with "possible" numbers included doubles down on statistical nonsense. When one knows the CDC rules of recording why someone died should be listed as covid without testing and use possible numbers where applicable, how does any of this statistics mean anything? ILLUSIONS are difficult to see when you are in one. And again nothing makes sense since there is not a reliable test...LMAO. Johns Hopkins map means nothing yet what a beautiful graphic for all of us to see gigantic RED circles on a map of Earth.
